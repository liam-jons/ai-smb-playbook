# Spec 1.8 — CLAUDE.md Files

> **Phase 2 build agent:** Agent 4 — Developer Track Sections
> **Track:** Developer

## Purpose

This section teaches Phew!'s developers how to create and maintain CLAUDE.md files — the single most impactful thing they can do to improve Claude Code's effectiveness on their projects. The content must move them from "never used one" to having a working CLAUDE.md file in their next session, understanding why it matters, how to structure it, and how to keep it current with the claude-md-management plugin's tools. The section establishes the foundational concept that CLAUDE.md is a map, not an encyclopedia — pointing Claude to deeper documentation rather than trying to contain everything — which directly sets up Section 1.9 (Documentation Structure).

| Doc structure suggestions | `.planning/source-context/suggestions-related-to-doc-structure.md` | The core "map not encyclopedia" principle: CLAUDE.md as table of contents, /docs as system of record. The OpenAI/Reddit approach — they tried a giant AGENTS.md and it failed because it crowded out the task, became non-guidance, rotted instantly, and was hard to verify.

## Content Outline

### 1. What CLAUDE.md Files Are and Why They Matter

**Opening paragraph** explaining the concept in plain terms:
- CLAUDE.md is a markdown file you place in the root of a project (or in subdirectories). Claude Code reads it automatically at the start of every session.
- It gives Claude project-specific context: what the project is, how to build it, what patterns to follow, where things live.
- Without it, Claude starts every session blind — it can read your code, but it does not know your conventions, your commands, your architecture decisions, or your gotchas.

**The impact framing** (keep it practical, not theoretical):
- A well-maintained CLAUDE.md is the single highest-leverage improvement you can make to Claude Code's output quality.
- It is cheap to create (15–30 minutes for a first version) and cheap to maintain (a few lines added per week).
- The difference: Claude stops asking "how do I run this?" and starts knowing. It stops guessing your conventions and starts following them.

**File types and where they live** (from the plugin skill file):

| Type | Location | Purpose | Shared? |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| Project root | `./CLAUDE.md` | Primary project context | Yes (checked into git) |
| Local overrides | `./.claude.local.md` | Personal/local settings | No (gitignored) |
| Global defaults | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | User-wide defaults | Personal only |
| Package-specific | `./packages/*/CLAUDE.md` | Module-level context in monorepos | Yes |
| Subdirectory | Any nested location | Feature/domain-specific context | Yes |

**Note:** Claude auto-discovers CLAUDE.md files in parent directories, so monorepo structures work automatically.

### 2. The "Map, Not Encyclopedia" Principle

This is the single most important structural concept. Present it as a clear, memorable principle.

**The problem with big CLAUDE.md files** (adapted from the OpenAI/Reddit source):
- Context is a scarce resource. A giant instruction file crowds out the task, the code, and the relevant docs.
- Too much guidance becomes non-guidance. When everything is "important," nothing is.
- Large files rot instantly. They become graveyards of stale rules that Claude cannot tell are outdated.
- They are hard to verify. A single blob does not lend itself to mechanical checks.

**The solution: CLAUDE.md as table of contents, /docs as system of record**
- Keep CLAUDE.md short (aim for under 500 lines, ideally under 200).
- Use it to tell Claude: what this project is, how to run it, what patterns to follow, and where to find deeper documentation.
- Deeper documentation lives in a structured `/docs` folder (covered in detail in Section 1.9).
- Claude navigates to the docs it needs, when it needs them — progressive disclosure.

**Present this as an Accordion or Collapsible with "before/after" examples:**
- **Before:** A 1,200-line CLAUDE.md that tries to document every API endpoint, every database table, every coding convention. Half of it is stale. Claude reads a summary of it and misses the two lines that actually matter for the current task.
- **After:** A 150-line CLAUDE.md with commands, architecture overview, key gotchas, and pointers to `/docs/architecture/`, `/docs/conventions/`, `/docs/schemas/`. Claude reads all of it, then navigates to the specific doc it needs for the current task.

**Cross-reference:** "For a complete guide to setting up the /docs structure, see Section 1.9 — Documentation Structure."

### 3. How to Structure a CLAUDE.md File

Present the recommended sections with guidance on what belongs in each. Use a tabbed or accordion layout so the user can explore each section.

**Recommended sections** (include only what is relevant to the project — not all sections are needed for every project):

1. **Project Description** (1–3 lines) — What this project is, in plain language.

2. **Commands** — The essential build/test/dev/lint/deploy commands. Present as a table for scannability. Every command must be copy-paste ready.

3. **Architecture** — A tree-style overview of the project structure with one-line descriptions of each directory. Not exhaustive — just the key directories. Point to `/docs/architecture/` for deeper detail.

4. **Key Files** — Entry points, configuration files, and any files a developer needs to know about that are not obvious from the directory structure.

5. **Code Style** — Project-specific conventions only. Not "use meaningful variable names" — that is generic advice. Things like: "we use camelCase for functions", "all API routes return typed responses", "error handling uses Result types not try/catch."

6. **Environment** — Required environment variables, setup steps, any prerequisites. Include the "no real users" note for development environments where applicable.

7. **Testing** — Test runner, how to run tests, testing conventions, any non-obvious testing patterns.

8. **Gotchas** — Non-obvious things that cause issues. Ordering dependencies, configuration quirks, common mistakes. This is often the most valuable section — it captures knowledge that is not obvious from reading the code.

9. **Workflow** — Development workflow patterns. When to use which branch, how deployments work, PR conventions.

10. **Documentation Pointers** — Links to `/docs/` subdirectories for deeper reference. This is the "map" part.

**Key principles for every section** (present as a callout/alert):
- **Be concise.** One line per concept when possible. CLAUDE.md is part of the prompt — every line costs tokens.
- **Be specific.** Use actual file paths, real commands from this project. Not generic advice.
- **Be current.** All information must reflect the actual codebase state. Stale information is worse than no information.
- **Be actionable.** Commands should be copy-paste ready. Instructions should be executable, not vague.

### 4. Best Practices from the Training

Present these as a practical checklist or tip list (from the training session content):

- **Tech stack specifications** — Document your framework versions, key dependencies, and why they were chosen. Claude uses this to write compatible code.
- **Development commands** — Every command a developer needs, documented in one place. Include flags and options that matter.
- **Architecture references** — Point to where Claude can learn about your system architecture. Do not dump the full architecture into CLAUDE.md.
- **Authentication patterns** — How auth works in this project. Which endpoints are protected, how tokens are handled, where session management lives.
- **Database schemas** — Point to schema files or docs. Include any non-obvious relationships or conventions (e.g., "all tables use soft deletes").
- **"No real users" note** — For development and staging environments, explicitly state: "This is a development environment. There are no real users. Test data can be created and deleted freely." This prevents Claude from being overly cautious with test data.
- **Keep it project-specific** — Do not include generic programming advice. If it would be true of any project, it does not belong in CLAUDE.md.

### 5. The claude-md-management Plugin

Introduce the two complementary tools from Anthropic's official plugin marketplace.

**Overview table:**

| | claude-md-improver (skill) | /revise-claude-md (command) |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Keep CLAUDE.md aligned with codebase | Capture session learnings |
| **When to use** | Periodic maintenance / audit | End of productive session |
| **Triggered by** | "audit my CLAUDE.md" or codebase changes | `/revise-claude-md` |
| **What it does** | Scores quality, identifies gaps, proposes updates | Reflects on session, drafts concise additions |
| **Output** | Quality report with scores + proposed diffs | Proposed additions as diffs |

**claude-md-improver skill — detailed walkthrough:**

The skill runs a five-phase workflow:
1. **Discovery** — Finds all CLAUDE.md files in the project.
2. **Quality Assessment** — Scores each file against six criteria (Commands 20pts, Architecture 20pts, Non-Obvious Patterns 15pts, Conciseness 15pts, Currency 15pts, Actionability 15pts). Assigns grades A–F.
3. **Quality Report** — Outputs a detailed report before making any changes.
4. **Targeted Updates** — Proposes specific additions as diffs, explaining why each helps.
5. **Apply with Approval** — Only edits files you approve.

Present the quality criteria as an interactive element (accordion or expandable cards) so developers can understand what "good" looks like.

**revise-claude-md command — detailed walkthrough:**

Best used at the end of a productive session. The workflow:
1. **Reflect** — Reviews the session for learnings: commands discovered, style patterns followed, testing approaches that worked, environment quirks, gotchas encountered.
2. **Find Files** — Locates all CLAUDE.md files and decides where each addition belongs (CLAUDE.md for team-shared, .claude.local.md for personal).
3. **Draft** — Writes concise one-line additions. Avoids verbose explanations, obvious information, and one-off fixes.
4. **Show Changes** — Presents each proposed addition as a diff with a brief explanation.
5. **Apply** — Only applies changes you approve.

**User tip (present as a callout):** During any Claude Code session, you can press the `#` key to have Claude automatically incorporate learnings into your CLAUDE.md file. This is the quickest way to capture context as you work.

**How to install:**
```
Install from the Anthropic plugin marketplace:
/plugin install claude-md-management
```

Alternatively, the skill and command files are available in the starter kit for manual installation (see Copyable Content below).

### 6. Getting Started: Your First CLAUDE.md

A clear, step-by-step walkthrough for creating a first CLAUDE.md file on an existing project:

1. **Create the file** — `touch CLAUDE.md` in the project root.
2. **Start with commands** — What are the 3–5 commands someone needs to work on this project? Add them first.
3. **Add architecture** — Run `tree -L 2 -d` (or similar) and annotate the key directories with one-line descriptions.
4. **Add gotchas** — Think about the last time something confused you or a colleague. Write it down.
5. **Add documentation pointers** — If you have docs, reference them. If you do not (most projects), note that Section 1.9 covers setting up a /docs structure.
6. **Commit it** — CLAUDE.md should be checked into git so the whole team benefits.

Present the copyable template (from the Copyable Content section below) as the practical output of this walkthrough.

## Interaction Design

### Components Used

| Component | Source | Usage |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `Card` | shadcn/ui | Quality criteria display, tool comparison cards |
| `Accordion` | shadcn/ui | CLAUDE.md section breakdown (expandable per section), before/after example |
| `Tabs` | shadcn/ui | Switching between skill and command tool views |
| `Alert` | shadcn/ui | Key principles callout, user tips (# shortcut), cross-references to other sections |
| `Badge` | shadcn/ui | Grade labels (A–F) on quality criteria |
| `Button` | shadcn/ui | Copy-to-clipboard on all code blocks and templates |
| `Collapsible` | shadcn/ui | Expanding detailed quality criteria within the audit section |
| `CodeBlock` | Custom (react-shiki) | All code examples, CLAUDE.md template, command examples |

### Layout

- **Mobile (< 640px):** Single column. Accordion for section breakdowns. Tabs stack as a scrollable row. All code blocks are full-width with horizontal scroll if needed.
- **Tablet (640px–1023px):** Single column with wider code blocks. Tool comparison table side-by-side.
- **Desktop (1024px+):** Max content width 65ch for body text. Code blocks can extend wider. Tool comparison and quality criteria can use two-column layouts where appropriate.

### Key Interactions

1. **Section structure accordion** — Each CLAUDE.md section (Commands, Architecture, etc.) expands to show guidance and an example. Only one section open at a time to avoid information overload.
2. **Tool comparison tabs** — Switch between claude-md-improver and /revise-claude-md views with detailed walkthroughs.
3. **Before/after collapsible** — Expand to see the contrast between a bloated CLAUDE.md and a well-structured one.
4. **Copy buttons** — On the full template, on each individual section example, on the install command.
5. **Quality criteria expandable** — The six scoring criteria can be expanded to show the full rubric (20/15/10/5/0 breakdown).

### Animation / Motion

- Accordion expand/collapse: shadcn built-in animation (CSS transition on height via grid-template-rows).
- Tab switching: instant (no animation needed — content swap is sufficient).
- Copy button feedback: icon switches from Copy to Check for 2 seconds.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` throughout.

## Copyable Content

### 1. Complete CLAUDE.md Template

This is the primary copyable deliverable for this section. It must be real and usable — not a skeleton with `[placeholder]` values, but a template with clear guidance comments that a developer replaces with their own content. Present it with a prominent copy button.

```markdown
# [Project Name]

[One-line description of what this project does.]

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install dependencies |
| `npm run dev` | Start development server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm test` | Run test suite |
| `npm run lint` | Lint and format check |

## Architecture

```
src/
  components/     # React components
  hooks/          # Custom React hooks
  services/       # API and business logic
  utils/          # Shared utility functions
  types/          # TypeScript type definitions
  pages/          # Route-level page components
public/           # Static assets
tests/            # Test files
docs/             # Project documentation (see Documentation Pointers)
```

## Key Files

- `src/main.tsx` — Application entry point
- `src/routes.tsx` — Route definitions
- `.env.local` — Local environment variables (not committed)

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Functions: camelCase. Components: PascalCase. Files: kebab-case for utilities, PascalCase for components
- API responses typed with Zod schemas at the boundary
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Error handling: use Result pattern in services, try/catch at route level only

## Environment

Required variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `API_KEY` | Third-party API authentication |

Setup:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Fill in values (credentials in team password manager)
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev`

**Note:** This is a development environment. There are no real users. Test data can be created and deleted freely.

## Testing

- `npm test` — Run all tests (Vitest)
- `npm run test:watch` — Watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage` — Coverage report
- Tests live alongside source files: `Component.test.tsx` next to `Component.tsx`
- Use `vi.mock()` for module mocks; prefer dependency injection over mocking where possible

## Gotchas

- The `auth` module must be initialised before any API calls — see `src/services/auth.ts`
- Database migrations run automatically in dev but require manual approval in production
- Hot reload does not pick up changes to `.env.local` — restart the dev server
- The legacy `/api/v1/` endpoints are still active but deprecated — all new work uses `/api/v2/`

## Documentation Pointers

For deeper reference, see the `/docs` directory:

- `docs/architecture/` — System architecture, domain model, data flow
- `docs/conventions/` — Coding standards, naming patterns, PR conventions
- `docs/integrations/` — Third-party service documentation (Stripe, SendGrid, etc.)
- `docs/schemas/` — Database schemas, API request/response schemas
```

### 2. Minimal CLAUDE.md Template (Quick Start)

For projects where a full template feels like too much to start with:

```markdown
# [Project Name]

[One-line description.]

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `[install command]` | Install dependencies |
| `[dev command]` | Start development server |
| `[test command]` | Run tests |

## Architecture

```
[Run `tree -L 2 -d` and paste the output here, then annotate key directories]
```

## Gotchas

- [First non-obvious thing that trips people up]
- [Second thing]
```

### 3. Plugin Install Command

```bash
/plugin install claude-md-management
```

### 4. Audit Prompt

A copyable prompt to trigger the claude-md-improver skill:

```
Audit my CLAUDE.md files. Check if they're up to date with the current codebase, score them against quality criteria, and propose any improvements.
```

### 5. Session-End Prompt

A copyable prompt for manually capturing session learnings (alternative to the /revise-claude-md command):

```
Before we end this session, review what we've done and identify any learnings that should be added to CLAUDE.md. Focus on: commands we discovered, patterns we followed, gotchas we encountered, and any configuration details that weren't documented. Propose changes as diffs and wait for my approval before applying.
```

## Two-Track Considerations

This is a **Developer track** section. General track users do not need to know about CLAUDE.md files (they use Claude via the browser/desktop app where CLAUDE.md is not relevant).

**Cross-references to General track:**
- Section 1.4 (Skills, Extensions & the Decision Tree) mentions CLAUDE.md as one of the extension mechanisms. That section provides a one-sentence description; this section provides the full guide.
- Section 1.2 (How Context Works) explains that CLAUDE.md is loaded at session start and consumes tokens. This section builds on that understanding — developers should keep CLAUDE.md concise partly because of the token cost explained in 1.2.

**Cross-references within Developer track:**
- Section 1.9 (Documentation Structure) is the natural next step after this section. The "map not encyclopedia" principle introduced here is expanded into a full /docs structure in 1.9.
- Section 1.10 (Codebase Mapping) provides a tool that can generate initial documentation to populate the /docs directory that CLAUDE.md points to.
- Section 1.14 (Plugin Recommendations) covers the claude-md-management plugin in the context of the broader plugin ecosystem. This section covers it in depth as a practical tool.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The section clearly explains what CLAUDE.md files are and why they matter, using practical language appropriate for a 10-person team new to structured AI workflows.
2. The "map not encyclopedia" principle is presented as a clear, memorable concept with a before/after example demonstrating the difference between a bloated file and a well-structured one.
3. All 10 recommended CLAUDE.md sections (Project Description, Commands, Architecture, Key Files, Code Style, Environment, Testing, Gotchas, Workflow, Documentation Pointers) are explained with guidance on what belongs in each.
4. The key principles (concise, specific, current, actionable) are prominently displayed — not buried in body text.
5. Best practices from the training are presented as a scannable checklist, including: tech stack specs, dev commands, architecture references, auth patterns, DB schemas, "no real users" note.
6. The claude-md-improver skill and /revise-claude-md command are both explained with clear descriptions of when to use each, what they do, and how to invoke them.
7. The quality scoring rubric (six criteria, grades A–F) is presented interactively (expandable/collapsible).
8. The `#` key shortcut tip is displayed prominently as a callout.
9. The complete CLAUDE.md template is a real, usable file — not a skeleton. It includes guidance comments and realistic example content that a developer can adapt to their own project.
10. The minimal (quick start) template is also provided as a lower-friction starting point.
11. The plugin install command, audit prompt, and session-end prompt are all copyable with copy-to-clipboard buttons.
12. A clear cross-reference to Section 1.9 (Documentation Structure) is included, positioning it as the natural next step.
13. The step-by-step "Getting Started" walkthrough gives a developer a clear path from zero to a working CLAUDE.md in 15–30 minutes.
14. All code blocks use syntax highlighting (Shiki via react-shiki) with appropriate language tags (markdown, bash).
15. All body text uses UK English spelling and grammar.
16. The page is fully responsive, with all content accessible on mobile.
17. Keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements (accordions, tabs, collapsibles, copy buttons).
