# Spec 1.5 — AI Governance Policy

> **Phase 2 build agent:** Agent 3 — Skills, Extensions, Governance & Brand
> **Track:** Both (General and Developer)

## Purpose

Present a complete, parameterised AI governance policy template as an interactive walkthrough within the playbook app. The policy covers how a small-to-medium business should evaluate, approve, deploy, maintain, and retire AI extensions across all Claude surfaces — MCPs/connectors, official marketplace plugins, third-party marketplace plugins, skills (internal and external), commands, and hooks.

The policy is designed for **SMB teams of 5–20 people** — proportionate guardrails, not enterprise bureaucracy. Language must be accessible, processes must be lightweight, and the whole thing must feel like "sensible rules for a small team" rather than ISO-grade compliance documentation.

The governance policy also exists as a **standalone downloadable document** in the starter kit (referenced as `starter-kit/templates/governance-policy.md`). The playbook section walks the user through it interactively; the starter kit file is the completed, ready-to-customise template.

**Cross-dependency:** This section is built by the same Phase 2 agent (Agent 3) as sections 1.4 (Skills, Extensions & the Decision Tree) and 1.6 (Brand Voice & UK English). The decision tree in 1.4 explains *what* each extension type is and *when* to use it; this section (1.5) defines *the process for approving and managing* those same extension types. The agent should ensure terminology is consistent across both sections and that cross-references link correctly.

---

## Source References

The build agent should read the following files:

| File | Path | Relevance |
|------|------|-----------|
| Phew! site content | `.planning/research/phew-site-content.md` | Company context: ISO 9001/27001/14001, Cyber Essentials Plus, IMPACT values, team size (9–11), safeguarding/public sector focus, data protection posture |
| Initial thoughts | `.planning/source-context/phew-initial-thoughts-for-meeting-follow-up.md` | Governance topic requests: "Create policy for Skills, plugins, connectors", "Safe process for adopting external skills", "Standards for internal skills" |

## Content Outline

The playbook section presents the governance policy as an interactive walkthrough with the following structure:

### 1. Section Introduction
- What this policy is and why it matters — framed for SMB context
- "This is not about creating red tape. It is about having a clear, lightweight process so your team can adopt new AI tools confidently without wondering whether they should have asked someone first."
- Note that the policy is parameterised — Phew! can use it as-is, and it can be adapted for other organisations by changing a few variables
- Link to download the standalone template from the starter kit

### 2. Interactive Policy Walkthrough
Each section of the policy is presented as an expandable accordion panel. The user can read through section-by-section, with explanatory notes alongside the policy text. Each panel shows the raw policy text (copyable) alongside a brief "why this matters" annotation.

### 3. How to Customise the Template
- Explain the `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` variables and what to substitute
- Guide on adapting the risk categories and approval thresholds to the organisation's context
- Suggest which sections to prioritise for immediate adoption vs. "grow into later"

### 4. Quick Start: Three Things to Do Today
- Actionable, non-overwhelming entry point
- (1) Designate an AI Lead, (2) Lock down extension installation permissions, (3) Start a simple register of what is already installed

---

## Interaction Design

### Layout
- Accordion-based walkthrough using shadcn `Accordion` component
- Each policy section is one accordion item
- Expanded state shows the policy text in a styled card with a copy button
- Alongside each policy section, a brief annotation card explains the rationale in plain language
- The full policy is also available as a single-page view (toggle between "Walkthrough" and "Full Document" modes)

### Parameterisation Display
- `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values are rendered as highlighted inline badges (shadcn `Badge` component, distinctive colour)
- On hover/tap, a tooltip explains what to substitute
- Example: `{{COMPANY_NAME}}` renders as a highlighted badge; tooltip says "Your company name, e.g. Phew Design Limited"

### Download
- "Download as Markdown" button at the top and bottom of the section
- Downloads the standalone template file from `starter-kit/templates/governance-policy.md`
- Copy-to-clipboard alternative for the full document

### Two-Track Presentation
- **General track:** Focus on the walkthrough with annotations. Present the policy as "here is what your organisation should put in place." Emphasise the Quick Start actions and the role of the AI Lead. Hide or minimise technical details about hooks, CI integration, and CLAUDE.md settings.
- **Developer track:** Show the full policy with additional technical implementation notes — how to enforce settings via CLAUDE.md, how hooks work for automated checks, how to structure `.claude/settings.json` for permission management, how the Britfix hook relates to governance.

## Copyable Content

### The Complete Parameterised Governance Policy Template

The following is the **full policy text** that must be included in the spec. The build agent should render this as the interactive walkthrough content AND generate the standalone file at `starter-kit/templates/governance-policy.md`.

```markdown
# AI Extension Governance Policy

**Organisation:** {{COMPANY_NAME}}
**Industry:** {{INDUSTRY}}
**Team size:** {{TEAM_SIZE}}
**Effective date:** {{EFFECTIVE_DATE}}
**Last reviewed:** {{LAST_REVIEWED}}
**Policy owner:** {{POLICY_OWNER}}
**Version:** 1.0

---

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes a clear, proportionate process for evaluating, approving, deploying, and maintaining AI extensions used with Claude across {{COMPANY_NAME}}. It covers all extension types: MCP servers (connectors), plugins, skills, commands, hooks, and subagents.

The goal is not to slow adoption down but to ensure that new AI capabilities are introduced thoughtfully — with consideration for data security, reliability, and long-term maintainability. For a team of {{TEAM_SIZE}} people, this means lightweight processes, clear ownership, and sensible defaults rather than bureaucratic approval chains.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- All staff at {{COMPANY_NAME}} who use Claude in any form (claude.ai, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, CoWork)
- All AI extensions installed, uploaded, or configured across any Claude environment
- Both production and development/testing environments

### Extension Types Covered

| Extension Type | Description | Example |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| **MCP servers (connectors)** | External services that give Claude access to tools, data sources, or APIs | Database connectors, file system access, browser automation |
| **Official marketplace plugins** | Plugins from Anthropic's verified plugin marketplace | commit-commands, pr-review-toolkit, security-guidance, coderabbit |
| **Third-party marketplace plugins** | Plugins from community or third-party marketplaces (e.g., skills.sh) | Community-contributed tools and integrations |
| **Internally developed skills** | Custom skill files (SKILL.md) created by {{COMPANY_NAME}} staff | Brand voice skill, UK English skill, session handoff skill |
| **Third-party skills** | Skill files obtained from external sources | Open-source skills, consultant-provided skills, partner-shared skills |
| **Commands** | Instruction files that define slash-command behaviour in Claude Code | /brand-review, /revise-claude-md |
| **Hooks** | Scripts that run automatically before or after Claude tool use | Britfix (UK English post-processing), linting hooks |
| **Subagents and agent teams** | Multi-agent configurations that delegate tasks to specialist agents | Codebase mapping agent, parallel build agents |

---

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

### AI Lead

{{COMPANY_NAME}} designates one person as the **AI Lead** — the primary point of contact for all AI extension decisions.

**Responsibilities:**
- Maintain the AI Extension Register (Section 7)
- Review and approve extension requests (or escalate to the MD for high-risk items)
- Conduct quarterly reviews of installed extensions
- Stay informed about Claude platform updates and new extension capabilities
- Coordinate with the team on best practices and share learnings
- Ensure this policy remains current and proportionate

**Suggested role holder:** A senior team member with both technical awareness and an understanding of {{COMPANY_NAME}}'s data handling obligations. This does not need to be a developer — it needs to be someone who can make informed risk judgements.

**Current AI Lead:** {{AI_LEAD_NAME}} ({{AI_LEAD_ROLE}})

### All Staff

- Do not install, upload, or configure AI extensions without following the approval process in Section 5
- Report any unexpected behaviour from AI extensions to the AI Lead
- Keep extensions up to date when notified of updates
- Remove extensions that are no longer needed

### Developers (Claude Code Users)

In addition to the above:
- Follow the technical standards in Section 6 when creating internal skills, commands, or hooks
- Include AI extension changes in code review processes
- Document any project-specific extensions in the project's CLAUDE.md file

---

## 4. Risk Categories

Extensions are classified into three risk tiers based on their potential impact. The tier determines the approval process.

### Tier 1 — Low Risk

**Characteristics:**
- Read-only or output-only functionality (no external data access)
- No access to sensitive data, customer information, or production systems
- From a verified/official source (Anthropic marketplace, known publisher)
- Affects only the individual user's workflow

**Examples:**
- Official Anthropic plugins (commit-commands, code-simplifier, context7)
- Internal skills that format output or enforce style rules (UK English, brand voice)
- Read-only MCP servers (documentation lookup, public API queries)

**Approval:** Self-approval. Log in the AI Extension Register and notify the AI Lead.

### Tier 2 — Medium Risk

**Characteristics:**
- Read/write access to internal systems, files, or repositories
- Accesses non-sensitive company data (project files, internal documentation)
- From a reputable but non-verified source (established open-source project, known community contributor)
- Affects team-wide workflows or shared environments

**Examples:**
- MCP servers connecting to internal databases or file systems
- Third-party skills from community marketplaces (skills.sh)
- Hooks that modify files automatically (Britfix, linting hooks)
- GitHub/repository integration plugins
- Skills provisioned organisation-wide by admin

**Approval:** AI Lead approval required. Submit a brief request (see Section 5) and wait for confirmation before installation.

### Tier 3 — High Risk

**Characteristics:**
- Access to sensitive data (customer PII, financial records, health data, safeguarding information)
- Access to production systems or live environments
- From an unknown, unverified, or new source
- Could affect data protection compliance (GDPR, ISO 27001)
- Involves automated actions with real-world consequences (sending emails, modifying databases, deploying code)

**Examples:**
- MCP servers connecting to customer databases, CRM, or production environments
- Any extension handling safeguarding data or personal information
- Browser automation tools operating on live client sites
- Agent teams with autonomous decision-making authority
- Any extension from a source not previously vetted

**Approval:** AI Lead review + MD sign-off. A written risk assessment (Section 5) must be completed and retained.

---

## 5. Approval Process

### Tier 1 — Self-Approval

1. Check the extension against the criteria in Section 4
2. Confirm it is Tier 1 (low risk)
3. Install or upload the extension
4. Add an entry to the AI Extension Register (Section 7)
5. Send a brief message to the AI Lead: "[Extension name] installed — Tier 1, [one-line description]"

### Tier 2 — AI Lead Approval

1. Submit a request to the AI Lead with:
   - **Extension name and source** (URL, marketplace listing, or file location)
   - **What it does** (one paragraph)
   - **Why you need it** (what problem it solves)
   - **What it accesses** (files, systems, data, APIs)
   - **Who will use it** (individual, team, or organisation-wide)
2. AI Lead reviews within **2 working days**
3. AI Lead either approves, requests more information, or escalates to Tier 3
4. If approved, the requestor installs and logs it in the register
5. AI Lead adds any conditions or review dates

### Tier 3 — AI Lead + MD Approval

1. Complete the Tier 2 request form, plus:
   - **Data sensitivity assessment:** What types of data does this extension access? Does it include personal data, customer data, or safeguarding information?
   - **Security review:** Who published this extension? Is the source code available for review? What permissions does it request? Is there a privacy policy?
   - **Compliance impact:** Does this affect our ISO 27001, Cyber Essentials Plus, or GDPR obligations?
   - **Fallback plan:** What happens if this extension fails, becomes unavailable, or is compromised?
2. AI Lead reviews and prepares a recommendation
3. MD reviews and approves or rejects
4. Decision and rationale are documented and retained
5. If approved, installation proceeds with any conditions noted

### Emergency Installation

If an extension is needed urgently (e.g., to resolve a production incident) and the AI Lead is unavailable:
1. Install the extension with the minimum permissions needed
2. Notify the AI Lead within **4 working hours**
3. Complete the standard approval process retrospectively within **2 working days**
4. If the retrospective review determines the extension is inappropriate, remove it immediately

---

## 6. Technical Standards for Internal Extensions

When {{COMPANY_NAME}} staff create skills, commands, hooks, or other extensions internally, they must meet these standards to ensure reliability and reusability.

### Skill Files (SKILL.md)

- Include complete YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields
- The `description` must use the `WHEN` / `WHEN NOT` pattern for accurate auto-invocation
- Write clear, specific instructions — another team member should understand the skill without explanation
- Include examples of expected input and output where relevant
- Use UK English throughout all documentation and user-facing text
- Test in at least one environment (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or claude.ai) before sharing
- Store project-specific skills in the project's `.claude/skills/` directory
- Store personal productivity skills in `~/.claude/skills/`

### Commands

- Include a clear trigger description and usage instructions
- Document expected inputs and outputs
- Follow the same UK English and quality standards as skills
- Store in the project's `.claude/commands/` directory

### Hooks

- Document what the hook does, when it triggers, and what it modifies
- Include the hook configuration for `.claude/settings.json`
- Test thoroughly — hooks run automatically and errors can disrupt workflows
- Set appropriate timeouts (hooks that hang block the user)
- Log hook activity where practical for troubleshooting

### Code Review

- All internal extensions shared team-wide must go through code review before deployment
- Review should check: correctness, security implications, UK English compliance, clarity of instructions
- Extensions provisioned organisation-wide via admin console must be reviewed by at least two people

### Version Control

- All internal extensions must be stored in version control (Git)
- Changes to team-shared extensions must be committed with clear commit messages
- Consider tagging versions for extensions provisioned organisation-wide

---

## 7. AI Extension Register

Maintain a register of all AI extensions in use across {{COMPANY_NAME}}. This can be a shared spreadsheet, a page in your internal wiki, or a markdown file in a shared repository.

### Register Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Extension name** | The name of the extension |
| **Type** | MCP server, plugin, skill, command, hook, or subagent |
| **Source** | Where it came from (Anthropic marketplace, GitHub URL, internal, etc.) |
| **Risk tier** | 1, 2, or 3 |
| **Approved by** | Who approved it (self, AI Lead, AI Lead + MD) |
| **Approval date** | When it was approved |
| **Installed by** | Who installed it |
| **Environment** | Where it is installed (individual, project, organisation-wide) |
| **What it accesses** | Brief description of data/system access |
| **Review date** | When it is next due for review |
| **Status** | Active, Under review, Deprecated, Removed |
| **Notes** | Any conditions, limitations, or observations |

### Register Template

```
| Extension | Type | Source | Tier | Approved By | Date | Environment | Review Date | Status |

## 8. Maintenance and Review

### Quarterly Review

The AI Lead conducts a brief review every quarter:

1. **Register audit:** Are all entries current? Any extensions no longer in use that should be removed?
2. **Update check:** Are extensions at their latest versions? Have any been deprecated or flagged for security issues?
3. **Usage review:** Are installed extensions actually being used? Unused extensions should be removed to reduce attack surface.
4. **Policy review:** Is this policy still proportionate? Does it need updating based on new Claude features, team growth, or changes in the business?

### Trigger-Based Reviews

In addition to scheduled quarterly reviews, conduct an immediate review when:

- Claude announces a major platform update affecting extensions
- A security vulnerability is reported in any installed extension
- {{COMPANY_NAME}} undergoes an ISO surveillance or certification audit
- A new team member joins (ensure they understand this policy)
- The team size changes significantly (thresholds may need adjusting)

### Deprecation and Removal

When an extension is no longer needed:

1. Confirm with all users that it is safe to remove
2. Remove from all environments (individual, project, organisation)
3. Update the AI Extension Register (set status to "Removed" — do not delete the row)
4. Retain the register entry for audit trail purposes

---

## 9. Data Protection Considerations

Given {{COMPANY_NAME}}'s work in {{INDUSTRY}} and its obligations under GDPR, ISO 27001, and Cyber Essentials Plus, the following additional considerations apply to all AI extensions:

### Data Handling Principles

- **Minimise data exposure:** Only grant extensions access to the data they genuinely need. If a tool can function with anonymised or sample data, use that instead of production data.
- **No customer PII in prompts without justification:** Avoid pasting customer personal data into Claude conversations unless there is a clear business need and the data handling is consistent with your privacy policy.
- **UK data residency:** Confirm that any MCP server or external integration does not transfer data outside the United Kingdom without appropriate safeguards.
- **Audit trail:** For Tier 3 extensions that handle sensitive data, maintain a log of when they were used and by whom.

### Safeguarding Data

{{COMPANY_NAME}} handles safeguarding data as part of its core business. No AI extension should ever be granted access to safeguarding case data, child protection information, or vulnerable person records without:

1. A formal Tier 3 risk assessment
2. MD approval
3. Confirmation that the data handling complies with relevant safeguarding legislation and {{COMPANY_NAME}}'s existing data protection policies
4. A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) if the extension introduces new processing of personal data

---

## 10. Incident Response

If an AI extension behaves unexpectedly, produces harmful output, or appears to have been compromised:

1. **Stop using the extension immediately** — disable or remove it
2. **Notify the AI Lead** within 1 working hour
3. **Document what happened** — what the extension did, what data was involved, what actions were taken
4. **Assess impact** — was any data exposed, corrupted, or sent externally?
5. **Report if required** — if personal data was involved, follow {{COMPANY_NAME}}'s existing data breach procedure (ICO notification within 72 hours if applicable)
6. **Root cause analysis** — determine why the incident occurred and whether similar extensions are affected
7. **Update the register** — record the incident against the relevant extension entry

---

## 11. Quick Start Guide

For teams adopting this policy for the first time, here are three things to do in the first week:

### Day 1: Designate an AI Lead

Choose one person to own AI extension governance. This should be someone who:
- Uses Claude regularly and understands its capabilities
- Has authority to make proportionate risk decisions
- Can commit 30 minutes per quarter to a review

### Day 1: Lock Down Installation Permissions

On Claude Teams, the admin should:
- Review which team members have permission to install extensions and MCP servers
- Consider restricting organisation-wide skill deployment to the AI Lead and admin
- Ensure individual users can still install Tier 1 (low-risk) extensions for personal use

### Week 1: Build the Initial Register

The AI Lead should:
- Ask each team member to list what extensions they currently have installed
- Compile the responses into the AI Extension Register template
- Classify each extension by risk tier
- Flag any Tier 2 or 3 extensions that were installed without formal review — these need retrospective approval, not removal (unless a genuine risk is identified)

| Hook | Claude Code only | Individual user | 2 | Runs automatically; test thoroughly |
| Subagent/agent team | Claude Code, CoWork | Developer, CoWork user | 2–3 | Can perform autonomous actions |
```

---

## Two-Track Considerations

### General Track

- Present the policy as a guided walkthrough — section-by-section accordions with plain-language annotations
- Emphasise the "Quick Start Guide" (Section 11) as the primary call to action
- Focus on Sections 1–5 (Purpose, Scope, Roles, Risk Categories, Approval Process) and Section 11 (Quick Start)
- Present the Risk Categories as a simple visual: three cards (Low / Medium / High) with colour coding and key examples
- Minimise technical jargon — "MCP server" should be accompanied by "(connector)" in parentheses throughout
- Hide or collapse Sections 6 (Technical Standards) and Appendix B (Extension Type Quick Reference) behind a "Developer details" disclosure
- The register template should be presented as a simple table with a "Download as spreadsheet" option

### Developer Track

- Show the full policy including all technical standards (Section 6)
- Add implementation notes alongside each section:
  - **Section 3 (Roles):** Show how to structure `.claude/settings.json` for permission management
  - **Section 6 (Technical Standards):** Link to examples in the starter kit (uk-english SKILL.md, brand-review SKILL.md) as reference implementations
  - **Section 8 (Maintenance):** Explain how to automate extension audits — e.g., a script that lists installed skills and plugins
- Show the hook governance angle: hooks run without user interaction, so they carry higher governance weight even if the functionality seems simple
- Cross-reference to Section 1.13 (Safe MCP Usage) and Section 1.14 (Plugin Recommendations) for technical setup details

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The complete governance policy template is rendered as an interactive accordion walkthrough
2. All `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values are visually distinct (badge + tooltip explaining what to substitute)
3. The full policy is available in a single-page "Full Document" view as well as the accordion walkthrough
4. A "Download as Markdown" button generates/links to the standalone template file
5. Copy-to-clipboard works on each individual section and on the full document
6. The policy covers all extension types listed in the scope table (MCP servers, official plugins, third-party plugins, internal skills, third-party skills, commands, hooks, subagents)
7. Risk categories are clearly differentiated with visual hierarchy (colour, icons, or layout)
8. The approval process is presented as a clear flow for each tier
9. The Quick Start Guide is prominently surfaced as the primary action for new adopters
10. General track hides or de-emphasises technical sections; developer track shows all content
11. Cross-references to sections 1.4 (Decision Tree), 1.13 (Safe MCP Usage), and 1.14 (Plugin Recommendations) are present and link correctly
12. The register template is rendered as a table and is copyable/downloadable
13. UK English is used throughout all policy text, annotations, and UI copy
14. Phew!-specific context is clearly parameterised — no hard-coded company references in the template itself (Phew! appears only in example values in Appendix A and in playbook annotations outside the template)
