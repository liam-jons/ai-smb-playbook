# Spec 1.14 — Plugin Recommendations

> **Phase 2 build agent:** Agent 4 — Developer Track Sections
> **Track:** Developer

## Purpose

This section provides Phew!'s development team with a comprehensive, curated catalogue of recommended Claude Code plugins from the official Anthropic marketplace (`claude-plugins-official`). For each plugin, the section explains what it does, when to use it, how to install it, and any security considerations. It also explains the distinction between official marketplace plugins and third-party marketplaces, the difference between installing a plugin (automatic updates) versus copying plugin files into a project (manual maintenance), and the governance approval process for adopting new plugins.

The curated list originates from the initial training follow-up discussions and has been verified against the actual plugin files in the starter kit. Every plugin mentioned in the original topic list is included, plus additional plugins from the official marketplace that are relevant to Phew!'s tech stack (WordPress/PHP, ASP.NET/C#, web applications).

This section cross-references section 1.5 (AI Governance Policy) for the approval process and section 1.2 (How Context Works) for context cost implications of plugins.

## Content Outline

### 1. What Are Plugins?

**Opening explanation (2–3 paragraphs):**

Plugins are the packaging layer for Claude Code extensions. A single plugin can bundle skills (knowledge and workflows), hooks (event-driven automation), subagents (isolated workers), MCP servers (external service connections), and LSP servers (code intelligence). When you install a plugin, you get all of its components in one step, with automatic updates when the plugin author releases improvements.

Think of plugins as "capability packs" for Claude Code. Instead of manually configuring an MCP server, writing hook scripts, and creating skill files separately, a plugin gives you all of those working together. For example, the Sentry plugin bundles an MCP connection to Sentry's API, skills for setting up monitoring, and a `/seer` command for querying your error data — all from a single install.

**Key concepts to convey:**
- Plugins are installed via `/plugin install <name>` or `claude plugin install <name>`
- Plugin skills are namespaced: `/plugin-name:command-name` (e.g., `/coderabbit:review`)
- Plugins from the official Anthropic marketplace (`claude-plugins-official`) auto-update by default
- Plugins can be installed at different scopes: User (all projects), Project (team-shared), Local (this machine only)

### 2. Installing vs Copying — Important Distinction

**Present this prominently — it directly addresses a point from the training.**

The starter kit delivered with this playbook includes reference copies of 14 plugins from the official marketplace (in `starter-kit/plugins/claude-plugins-official/`). These files are included so you can review what each plugin contains and how it is structured. However, **copying plugin files into your project is not the same as installing the plugin.**

| Approach | Automatic updates | Team sharing | Setup effort |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Install via marketplace** (`/plugin install`) | Yes — auto-updates when author publishes changes | Yes — install scope can be User or Project | Minimal — one command |
| **Copy files into project** | No — you must manually check for and apply updates | Yes — files are in version control | More work — must maintain manually |

**Recommendation:** Always install plugins from the marketplace when available. Use copied files only for review, customisation, or when you need to pin a specific version.

### 3. Context Cost of Plugins

**Cross-reference to section 1.2** — link back to the context window simulator.

**How plugins affect your context window:**
- Plugin **skill descriptions** load at session start (low cost — just names and short descriptions)
- Plugin **full skill content** loads only when Claude uses the skill or you invoke it with `/<name>` (burst cost — can be significant for large skills)
- Plugin **MCP servers** load tool definitions at session start (ongoing cost — same as standalone MCP, see section 1.13)
- Plugin **hooks** have zero context cost (they run externally)
- Plugin **LSP servers** have zero direct context cost (diagnostics are injected only when relevant)

**Practical implication:** Having many plugins installed does not immediately fill your context window. The cost scales with how many skills Claude loads during a session. However, many plugins with many skill descriptions can create noise that makes Claude less effective at choosing the right skill.

**Actionable advice:**
- Install plugins you actively use; uninstall plugins you have stopped using
- Use `/plugin` to see installed plugins and their status
- If Claude is not triggering the right skills, you may have too many competing descriptions

### 4. Plugin Catalogue — Official Marketplace

Present each plugin in a consistent format. Group plugins into categories for easier scanning. Each plugin entry should use a shadcn Card or a visually consistent block with the following structure:

**Per-plugin template:**
- **Name** (with Badge: "Anthropic" or author name)
- **One-line description**
- **What it provides** (skills, commands, hooks, MCP, agents — use badges/tags)
- **When to use it** (1–2 sentences, specific to Phew!'s workflow where possible)
- **Install command** (copyable)
- **Security/governance notes** (if applicable)

---

#### Category A: Development Workflow

##### commit-commands
- **Author:** Anthropic
- **Description:** Streamlines git workflow with commands for committing, pushing, and creating pull requests.
- **Provides:** 3 slash commands (`/commit`, `/commit-push-pr`, `/clean_gone`)
- **What it does:**
  - `/commit` — Analyses your changes, matches your repository's commit style, stages files, and creates a commit with an appropriate message. Includes Claude Code attribution. Avoids committing files with secrets (.env, credentials).
  - `/commit-push-pr` — Complete workflow: creates a branch (if on main), commits, pushes, and creates a pull request via GitHub CLI (`gh`). Analyses the full branch history for the PR description.
  - `/clean_gone` — Cleans up local branches that have been deleted from the remote. Removes associated worktrees and stale branches.
- **When to use it:** Daily development workflow. Reduces context-switching between coding and git operations. Especially useful for maintaining consistent commit messages across the team.
- **Requirements:** Git installed. For `/commit-push-pr`: GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated.
- **Install:**
  ```bash
  /plugin install commit-commands
  ```

##### pr-review-toolkit
- **Author:** Anthropic (Daisy Hollman)
- **Description:** Comprehensive collection of six specialised agents for thorough pull request review.
- **Provides:** 6 review agents, 1 command (`/review-pr`)
- **What it does:**
  - **code-reviewer** — General code review for CLAUDE.md compliance, style violations, and bug detection. Scores issues 0–100.
  - **comment-analyzer** — Checks code comment accuracy against actual code. Identifies comment rot, misleading documentation, and technical debt.
  - **pr-test-analyzer** — Evaluates test coverage quality, critical gaps, edge cases, and error conditions. Rates test gaps 1–10 (10 = critical).
  - **silent-failure-hunter** — Finds silent failures in catch blocks, inadequate error handling, and missing error logging.
  - **type-design-analyzer** — Rates type design quality across four dimensions (encapsulation, invariant expression, usefulness, enforcement), each 1–10.
  - **code-simplifier** — Identifies unnecessary complexity, redundant abstractions, and overly compact code. Preserves functionality while improving clarity.
- **When to use it:** Before creating PRs, after code review feedback, and during periodic code quality audits. The agents trigger automatically based on your requests, or you can invoke specific ones.
- **Install:**
  ```bash
  /plugin install pr-review-toolkit
  ```

##### code-simplifier
- **Author:** Anthropic
- **Description:** Standalone agent that simplifies and refines code for clarity, consistency, and maintainability while preserving functionality.
- **Provides:** 1 agent (code-simplifier)
- **What it does:** Analyses code for unnecessary complexity, redundant abstractions, inconsistent patterns, and overly compact logic. Suggests simplifications that preserve behaviour.
- **When to use it:** After getting code working but before finalising. Good for refactoring sessions. Note: this is also included as part of `pr-review-toolkit` — if you have that installed, you may not need this separately.
- **Install:**
  ```bash
  /plugin install code-simplifier
  ```

##### claude-md-management
- **Author:** Anthropic (Isabella He)
- **Description:** Tools to maintain and improve CLAUDE.md files — audit quality, capture session learnings, and keep project memory current.
- **Provides:** 1 skill (claude-md-improver), 1 command (`/revise-claude-md`)
- **What it does:**
  - **claude-md-improver** (skill) — Audits CLAUDE.md files against the current codebase state. Identifies outdated instructions, missing conventions, and quality issues. Triggered by asking "audit my CLAUDE.md files" or "check if my CLAUDE.md is up to date".
  - **`/revise-claude-md`** (command) — Captures learnings from the current session and proposes updates to CLAUDE.md. Best used at the end of a session where you discovered missing context.
- **When to use it:** Periodically (weekly or after major changes) to keep CLAUDE.md accurate. Also useful after sessions where Claude needed explicit guidance that should have been in the CLAUDE.md file. Directly supports section 1.9 (CLAUDE.md Files).
- **Install:**
  ```bash
  /plugin install claude-md-management
  ```

---

#### Category B: Security & Code Quality

##### security-guidance
- **Author:** Anthropic
- **Description:** Security reminder hook that warns about potential security issues when editing files, including command injection, XSS, and unsafe code patterns.
- **Provides:** 1 hook (PreToolUse on Edit/Write/MultiEdit)
- **What it does:** Runs a Python script before every file edit, checking for common security issues: command injection patterns, cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, unsafe code practices. Surfaces warnings before the edit is applied.
- **When to use it:** Always-on for projects that handle user input, authentication, or sensitive data — which includes all of Phew!'s web applications (LMS, Audit System, PDMS). Particularly important for safeguarding-sector software.
- **Security note:** This is a preventive tool, not a replacement for proper security review. It catches common patterns but will not find all vulnerabilities.
- **Requirements:** Python 3 must be installed (standard on macOS).
- **Install:**
  ```bash
  /plugin install security-guidance
  ```

##### coderabbit
- **Author:** CodeRabbit AI
- **Description:** AI-powered code review in Claude Code, powered by CodeRabbit.
- **Provides:** 1 command (`/coderabbit:review`), 1 skill (code-review), 1 agent (code-reviewer)
- **What it does:** Runs CodeRabbit's AI code review engine within Claude Code. Reviews all changes, committed changes, or uncommitted changes. Presents findings grouped by severity. Supports comparing against a specific branch.
- **When to use it:** As a second opinion on code quality, in addition to the built-in `pr-review-toolkit`. CodeRabbit provides a different perspective from an external AI review service. Useful for catching issues that internal review might miss.
- **Requirements:** CodeRabbit CLI must be installed and authenticated:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://cli.coderabbit.ai/install.sh | sh
  coderabbit auth login
  ```
- **Security note:** CodeRabbit sends your code to an external service for analysis. Ensure this is acceptable under your data handling policies (governance policy, section 1.5). For projects with sensitive client data, discuss with the team before enabling.
- **Install:**
  ```bash
  /plugin install coderabbit
  ```

---

#### Category C: External Service Integrations

##### github
- **Author:** GitHub
- **Description:** Official GitHub MCP server for repository management.
- **Provides:** 1 MCP server (GitHub API via HTTP)
- **What it does:** Gives Claude Code direct access to GitHub's API: create issues, manage pull requests, review code, search repositories, manage branches, read file contents from remote repos, and more — all without leaving the Claude Code session.
- **When to use it:** Any workflow involving GitHub: creating issues from code analysis, reviewing PRs, searching for similar issues, managing project boards. Essential if your team uses GitHub for project management beyond just version control.
- **Requirements:** GitHub Personal Access Token stored as `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.
- **Security note:** The token grants Claude access to your GitHub repositories. Use a fine-grained personal access token with the minimum required permissions. Do not use a token with admin or delete access unless specifically needed. Rotate tokens periodically.
- **Install:**
  ```bash
  /plugin install github
  ```
- **Post-install:** Set your token as an environment variable:
  ```bash
  export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="ghp_your_token_here"
  ```

##### context7
- **Author:** Upstash
- **Description:** Up-to-date documentation lookup via MCP. Pulls version-specific documentation and code examples directly from source repositories into Claude's context.
- **Provides:** 1 MCP server (Context7 via stdio/npx)
- **What it does:** When Claude needs documentation for a library, framework, or tool, Context7 fetches the current documentation from the actual source repository — not from Claude's training data, which may be outdated. Supports version-specific lookups.
- **When to use it:** Any time you are working with third-party libraries and want Claude to reference current documentation rather than potentially outdated training data. Reduces hallucination risk for API usage, configuration options, and breaking changes.
- **Note:** Similar functionality to the deepwiki MCP server (section 1.13). Choose one — running both is redundant and doubles the context cost for documentation lookups. Context7 is available as an official plugin (automatic updates, managed installation); deepwiki is a standalone MCP server (manual configuration).
- **Install:**
  ```bash
  /plugin install context7
  ```

##### playwright
- **Author:** Microsoft
- **Description:** Browser automation and end-to-end testing MCP server.
- **Provides:** 1 MCP server (Playwright via stdio/npx)
- **What it does:** Gives Claude Code full browser control: navigate to pages, take screenshots, fill forms, click elements, extract text, and run end-to-end test workflows. See section 1.13 for detailed setup and safety guidance.
- **When to use it:** Testing web applications, verifying CSS changes, running regression checks, automating repetitive browser-based workflows. Directly relevant to Phew!'s web application work and potential Ghost Inspector replacement (section 1.12).
- **Security note:** Full browser control means Claude can navigate to any URL and interact with any page. Use only on staging/development environments. See the safety guidance in section 1.13 for credential handling and access scope.
- **Install:**
  ```bash
  /plugin install playwright
  ```

##### sentry
- **Author:** Sentry
- **Description:** Sentry plugin for Claude Code — debugging, error monitoring, and performance tracking.
- **Provides:** 1 MCP server (Sentry HTTP API), 1 command (`/seer`), 6 skills (code review, AI monitoring setup, iOS setup, logging, metrics, tracing)
- **What it does:**
  - **`/seer`** — Natural language queries against your Sentry environment ("What errors happened in production today?", "Show me the most common exceptions this week").
  - **sentry-code-review** (skill) — Analyses and resolves Sentry bot comments on GitHub PRs.
  - **Setup skills** — Guided setup for Sentry monitoring: AI monitoring (OpenAI/Anthropic/Vercel AI), structured logging, metrics, distributed tracing, and iOS/Swift integration.
- **When to use it:** If Phew! uses or plans to use Sentry for error monitoring and performance tracking. The `/seer` command is particularly powerful for debugging production issues without leaving Claude Code.
- **Requirements:** Sentry account. The MCP server connects to `https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp` — authentication is handled through the Sentry web interface.
- **Install:**
  ```bash
  /plugin install sentry
  ```

##### asana
- **Author:** Asana
- **Description:** Asana project management integration for Claude Code.
- **Provides:** 1 MCP server (Asana SSE API)
- **What it does:** Create and manage tasks, search projects, update assignments, track progress, and integrate your development workflow with Asana's work management platform — all from within Claude Code.
- **When to use it:** If Phew! uses Asana for project management. Enables workflows like "create a task for this bug" or "update the task status to complete" without switching to the Asana web interface.
- **Requirements:** Asana account with appropriate permissions.
- **Install:**
  ```bash
  /plugin install asana
  ```

---

#### Category D: Language & Code Intelligence

##### php-lsp
- **Author:** Anthropic (official marketplace)
- **Description:** PHP language server (Intelephense) for Claude Code, providing code intelligence and diagnostics.
- **Provides:** 1 LSP server (Intelephense)
- **What it does:** Gives Claude Code real-time PHP code intelligence: automatic diagnostics after every file edit (type errors, missing imports, syntax issues), jump to definition, find references, hover type information, list symbols, and find implementations.
- **When to use it:** Any PHP/WordPress project. This is particularly relevant for Phew!'s WordPress work — it means Claude Code can catch PHP errors, understand class hierarchies, and navigate the codebase with IDE-level precision.
- **Requirements:** Intelephense must be installed globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g intelephense
  ```
- **Note on LSP plugins:** LSP (Language Server Protocol) is a newer plugin component type. LSP plugins provide code intelligence — they run in the background and feed diagnostics to Claude, helping it write more accurate code. There are official LSP plugins for 11+ languages (TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, Kotlin, C/C++, PHP, Ruby, C#, Swift).
- **Install:**
  ```bash
  /plugin install php-lsp
  ```

---

#### Category E: Plugin Development

##### plugin-dev
- **Author:** Anthropic (Daisy Hollman)
- **Description:** Comprehensive toolkit for developing Claude Code plugins with expert guidance on hooks, MCP integration, plugin structure, and marketplace publishing.
- **Provides:** 7 skills, 1 command (`/plugin-dev:create-plugin`), 3 agents (agent-creator, skill-reviewer, plugin-validator)
- **What it does:** A meta-plugin — it helps you build your own plugins. Provides expert guidance on:
  - Hook development (event-driven automation)
  - MCP integration (connecting external services)
  - Plugin structure (directory layout, manifest configuration)
  - Plugin settings (configuration patterns)
  - Command development (slash commands)
  - Agent development (autonomous agents)
  - Skill development (knowledge and workflows)
  - The `/plugin-dev:create-plugin` command walks you through an 8-phase plugin creation process.
- **When to use it:** When your team is ready to create custom plugins — either for internal workflows or to share across Phew!'s projects. This is an advanced tool; start with using existing plugins before building your own.
- **Install:**
  ```bash
  /plugin install plugin-dev
  ```

### 4b. Other Recommended Third-Party Tools

The coverage checklist also includes third-party tools that are not Claude Code plugins but are relevant to Phew!'s development workflow:

##### Mintlify
- **Type:** External SaaS platform (not a Claude Code plugin)
- **Website:** https://mintlify.com
- **Description:** Documentation-as-code platform that generates polished, searchable documentation sites from markdown files in your repository. Supports API reference generation, versioning, and custom domains.
- **Why it matters for Phew!:** Directly complements the documentation structure recommendations in section 1.9. If Phew! adopts the `/docs` structure and maintains markdown documentation, Mintlify can turn those files into a professional hosted documentation site with search, navigation, and analytics — with zero frontend work.
- **How it integrates with Claude workflows:** Claude can generate and maintain markdown docs (see sections 1.9 and 1.10). Mintlify consumes those same markdown files and publishes them. This creates a pipeline: Claude writes/updates docs → Mintlify publishes them automatically.
- **Getting started:** Free tier available. Connect your GitHub repository and point Mintlify at your `/docs` folder. Changes pushed to the repo are published automatically.
- **Governance note:** Mintlify reads your repository content to generate documentation. Review their data handling policies before connecting repositories with sensitive code. Follow the approval process in section 1.5.

##### agent-browser (Skill)
- **Type:** Claude skill (available in starter kit at `starter-kit/skills/agent-browser/`)
- **Description:** Automates browser interactions for web testing, form filling, screenshots, and data extraction. Invoked via natural language in any Claude environment.
- **Why it matters for Phew!:** Provides browser automation capabilities for users on claude.ai/Desktop (where Playwright MCP is not available). Relevant to the regression testing approaches discussed in section 1.12.
- **How to install:** Copy the skill folder to `.claude/skills/agent-browser/` (Claude Code) or upload via Settings > Capabilities > Skills (claude.ai/Desktop).

---

### 5. Official vs Third-Party Marketplaces

**Present this as a clear comparison:**

| Aspect | Official Marketplace (`claude-plugins-official`) | Third-Party Marketplaces |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Source** | Maintained by Anthropic | Community-maintained GitHub repositories |
| **Vetting** | Reviewed by Anthropic | Varies — no guaranteed review process |
| **Auto-updates** | Yes (default) | Configurable per marketplace |
| **Trust level** | High — backed by Anthropic | Variable — review before installing |
| **Examples** | All plugins listed above | skills.sh, ClaudePluginHub, Claude-Plugins.dev |
| **How to add** | Auto-available at startup | Add marketplace URL via `/plugin` menu |

**Governance recommendation:**
- Start with the official marketplace only. All plugins listed in this section are from `claude-plugins-official`.
- Before adding any third-party marketplace, follow the approval process in the governance policy (section 1.5).
- Third-party plugins can contain arbitrary code (hooks, shell commands). Review the plugin source before installing.
- The managed setting `strictKnownMarketplaces` can restrict which marketplace sources are allowed — useful if Phew! wants to lock down plugin sources across the team.

### 6. Managing Installed Plugins

**Key commands (all copyable):**

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/plugin` | Opens the plugin manager (Discover, Installed, Marketplaces, Errors tabs) |
| `/plugin install <name>` | Installs a plugin from an available marketplace |
| `/plugin marketplace update` | Refreshes marketplace listings to get latest plugins |
| `claude plugin validate .` | Validates a plugin (useful when developing your own) |

**Best practices for plugin management:**
- Review installed plugins periodically — uninstall plugins you are no longer using
- Check for plugin errors in the `/plugin` Errors tab
- If a plugin is not working as expected, try updating the marketplace (`/plugin marketplace update`) and reinstalling
- Plugin skills are namespaced, so multiple plugins can coexist without conflicts (e.g., `/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr` and `/coderabbit:review` are separate commands)

### 7. Starter Kit Reference Copies

**Brief note explaining the files in the starter kit:**

The starter kit includes reference copies of 14 plugins from the official marketplace in `starter-kit/plugins/claude-plugins-official/`. These files are provided so you can:
- Review what each plugin contains before installing
- Understand plugin structure (useful if you plan to create your own)
- Reference specific configurations or skill content offline

**These are snapshots, not live plugins.** To use a plugin, install it from the marketplace — this gives you automatic updates and proper integration with Claude Code. The starter kit copies are for reference only.

### 8. Governance Cross-Reference

**Callout (shadcn Alert, informational variant):**

Before installing any new plugin, follow the approval process in the AI Governance Policy (section 1.5). The governance policy covers:
- **Official marketplace plugins:** Lower barrier — review the plugin description, check what permissions it needs (MCP connections, hooks that run on file edits), confirm it aligns with your data handling policies
- **Third-party marketplace plugins:** Higher barrier — review source code, check the author's reputation, verify what data the plugin accesses, get team lead approval
- **Plugins with external API connections** (GitHub, Sentry, Asana, CodeRabbit): Require additional review of data handling — what data is sent to the external service, what permissions the API token grants, how tokens are stored and rotated
- **Periodic review:** Audit installed plugins quarterly. Remove plugins that are no longer needed. Check for security advisories on plugins that connect to external services.

## Interaction Design

### Components Used

| Component | Source | Usage |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `Card` | shadcn/ui | Individual plugin entries — one card per plugin with consistent structure |
| `Badge` | shadcn/ui | Author labels ("Anthropic", "Microsoft", "Sentry", etc.), component type tags ("MCP", "Skills", "Hooks", "LSP", "Agents"), category labels |
| `Accordion` | shadcn/ui | Plugin categories (Development Workflow, Security, External Services, Language Intelligence, Plugin Development) — collapsible groups. Individual plugins within each category can also be collapsible for scanning. |
| `Alert` | shadcn/ui | Security warnings on plugins with external connections, governance cross-reference, "installing vs copying" callout |
| `Separator` | shadcn/ui | Visual dividers between plugin categories |
| `Tooltip` | shadcn/ui | Technical terms (LSP, MCP, namespace, stdio) |
| `Tabs` | shadcn/ui | Optional: switching between "Browse Catalogue" and "Quick Reference" views (the quick reference being a compact table of all plugins with one-line descriptions and install commands) |

### Code Blocks

All install commands and configuration examples must use the `CodeBlock` component (Shiki + CopyButton pattern). Language hints:
- Install commands: `bash`
- Configuration JSON: `json`

### Layout

- **Mobile (< 640px):** Single column. Plugin cards stack vertically. Category accordions are full-width.
- **Tablet (640px–1023px):** Plugin cards may use a compact layout. Content is single-column.
- **Desktop (1024px+):** Plugin cards can use a two-column grid within categories (but avoid identical repeating card grids — vary the card content enough that it does not look templated). Max content width: 65ch for body text within cards.

### Plugin Card Structure

Each plugin card should follow a consistent but not rigid layout:
1. **Header:** Plugin name + author badge
2. **Description:** One-line summary
3. **Component tags:** Badges showing what the plugin provides (Skills, Commands, Hooks, MCP, Agents, LSP)
4. **Details:** Expandable content with full description, usage guidance, requirements, and security notes
5. **Install command:** Always visible, with copy button
6. **Security indicator:** If the plugin connects to an external service or runs hooks on file edits, show a small warning badge or icon

### Quick Reference Table

In addition to the detailed catalogue, provide a compact reference table (all plugins, one row each) for developers who already know what they want:

| Plugin | Author | Components | Install |
|--------|--------|-----------|---------|
| commit-commands | Anthropic | Commands | `/plugin install commit-commands` |
| pr-review-toolkit | Anthropic | Agents, Command | `/plugin install pr-review-toolkit` |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

This table should have copy buttons on each install command.

## Copyable Content

Every install command and configuration example below must have a copy-to-clipboard button via the `CopyButton` component.

### Plugin Approval Checklist (Copyable Reference)
```markdown
## Plugin Approval Checklist

Before installing a new plugin:
- [ ] Is it from the official Anthropic marketplace?
- [ ] If third-party: has the source code been reviewed?
- [ ] What components does it include? (Skills, Hooks, MCP, Agents, LSP)
- [ ] Does it connect to external services? If so, what data is sent?
- [ ] What credentials/tokens does it need? How will they be stored?
- [ ] Does it run hooks on file edits? If so, what does the hook do?
- [ ] Has the team lead approved the installation?
- [ ] Has it been added to the project's plugin inventory?
```

### Recommended Starter Plugins (Batch Install)
```bash
# Recommended starter set for Phew! developers
/plugin install commit-commands
/plugin install pr-review-toolkit
/plugin install security-guidance
/plugin install claude-md-management
/plugin install php-lsp
/plugin install github
```

## Two-Track Considerations

This section is **Developer track only**. Plugins are a Claude Code feature — they are not available to users of claude.ai or Claude Desktop.

The General track equivalent is section 1.4 (Skills & Extensions Decision Tree), which covers the broader concept of extending Claude's capabilities. General track users will encounter "Projects" and "custom instructions" in claude.ai, but these are not plugins.

**No General track variant is needed.** This section is entirely Developer track content.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Every plugin from the curated list in the initial thoughts document is included: commit-commands, plugin-dev, pr-review-toolkit, security-guidance, code-simplifier, github, context7, playwright, claude-md-management, sentry, php-lsp, coderabbit.
2. The asana plugin (present in the starter kit reference copies) is also included as it demonstrates the external integration pattern.
3. Each plugin entry includes: name, author, one-line description, component types (badges), detailed description of what it does, when to use it, install command (copyable), and security/governance notes where applicable.
4. Plugins are grouped into meaningful categories (Development Workflow, Security & Code Quality, External Service Integrations, Language & Code Intelligence, Plugin Development).
5. The distinction between official marketplace and third-party marketplaces is clearly explained with a comparison table.
6. The "Installing vs Copying" section explicitly states that starter kit files are reference copies and that installing from the marketplace gives automatic updates.
7. Context cost implications of plugins are explained, linking back to section 1.2.
8. The governance cross-reference (section 1.5) is present and covers the approval process for both official and third-party plugins.
9. A compact quick-reference table is provided alongside the detailed catalogue for fast scanning.
10. The "Recommended Starter Plugins" batch install is provided as a copyable block.
11. The plugin approval checklist is copyable as a standalone reference.
12. All install commands have copy-to-clipboard buttons.
13. Security notes are present on plugins that connect to external services (GitHub, Sentry, Asana, CodeRabbit) and on plugins that run hooks (security-guidance).
14. The note about Context7 vs deepwiki overlap (section 1.13) is present, guiding developers to choose one.
15. Plugin descriptions are accurate — verified against the actual plugin.json and README files in the starter kit.
16. UK English is used throughout all copy.
17. The section is fully navigable by keyboard (accordion items, tab panels, copy buttons).
18. Touch targets on all interactive elements are at least 44px.
19. The section respects `prefers-reduced-motion` for any animated elements.
20. Plugin cards avoid the "identical repeating card grid" anti-pattern — vary content density and structure enough to avoid a templated appearance.

## Build Agent Checklist

### Frontend Quality Checklist

**Typography**
- [ ] Body text >= 16px (1rem), using rem units
- [ ] Max line length: 65ch for body text
- [ ] Fluid type (clamp) on headings; fixed sizes on UI controls
- [ ] Font stacks include size-adjusted fallback
- [ ] No generic fonts (Inter, Roboto, etc.) unless explicitly specified

**Colour & Theming**
- [ ] All custom colours defined in OKLCH via CSS variables
- [ ] Neutrals tinted towards brand hue (not pure grey)
- [ ] No pure black (#000) or pure white (#fff)
- [ ] Dark mode tested and functional (if applicable to section)
- [ ] All text meets WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large/UI)

**Layout & Spacing**
- [ ] Spacing values from the 4pt grid (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96)
- [ ] Visual hierarchy uses 2+ dimensions (size, weight, colour, space)
- [ ] No nested cards
- [ ] No identical repeating card grids

**Motion & Animation**
- [ ] Only `transform` and `opacity` animated (no width/height/top/left)
- [ ] Timing follows 100/300/500 rule
- [ ] Easing uses exponential curves (not default `ease` or bounce)
- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion` handled (crossfade fallback or disable)
- [ ] Exit animations faster than entrances
- [ ] Motion used via Tailwind transitions where CSS suffices; Motion library only for layout/enter/exit

**Interaction**
- [ ] All 8 interactive states designed (default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error, success)
- [ ] `:focus-visible` ring on all interactive elements (2-3px, offset, 3:1 contrast)
- [ ] Touch targets >= 44px
- [ ] Copy-to-clipboard on every prompt/template/code block
- [ ] Skeleton screens for loading states (not generic spinners)

**Accessibility**
- [ ] Semantic HTML (headings, landmarks, labels)
- [ ] Skip link present
- [ ] Keyboard navigation tested (Tab, Enter, Escape, Arrows)
- [ ] `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls` on accordions/collapsibles
- [ ] `aria-label` on icon-only buttons
- [ ] Images have `alt` text (or `alt=""` for decorative)
- [ ] Never `outline: none` without `:focus-visible` replacement

**Performance**
- [ ] No barrel file imports (direct imports from source)
- [ ] Shiki lazy-loaded (not in initial bundle)
- [ ] Derived state computed during render (no useEffect for derived values)
- [ ] `content-visibility: auto` on long scrollable content
- [ ] Passive event listeners on scroll/touch handlers
- [ ] Static JSX hoisted outside components where possible

**Responsive**
- [ ] Mobile-first (base styles for mobile, min-width queries for larger)
- [ ] Tested at 320px, 640px, 768px, 1024px widths
- [ ] No critical functionality hidden on mobile
- [ ] Hover-dependent features have touch alternatives
- [ ] Safe area insets handled for mobile

**UX Writing & Content**
- [ ] UK English throughout (spelling, grammar, currency, date format)
- [ ] Button labels use verb + object pattern
- [ ] Error messages answer: what, why, how to fix
- [ ] Consistent terminology (no synonyms for the same action)
- [ ] Empty states are actionable, not just "Nothing here"

**Code Quality**
- [ ] Tailwind utility classes only (no CSS modules or styled-components)
- [ ] `cn()` utility for conditional class merging
- [ ] `@/` path alias for all imports
- [ ] Components composed from shadcn primitives (not mega-components)
- [ ] Content defined as typed TS objects, not hard-coded JSX
