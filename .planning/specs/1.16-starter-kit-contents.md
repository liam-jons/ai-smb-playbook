# Spec 1.16 — Starter Kit Contents

> **Phase 2 build agent:** Agent 5 — Starter Kit Files
> **Track:** Both (files are used by both General and Developer users)

## Purpose

The starter kit is a collection of ready-to-use skill files, command files, templates, prompts, and reference copies of plugins that Phew! staff can drop into their Claude environments immediately. It is delivered in two ways: as downloadable files from within the playbook app, and as the `starter-kit/` folder in the project repository. This spec inventories everything that currently exists, defines what needs to be created or updated, and specifies how the starter kit section appears in the playbook app.

The starter kit serves three audiences simultaneously:
1. **General users (claude.ai / Claude Desktop):** Skills they can upload via Settings > Capabilities, plus templates and prompts they can copy-paste.
2. **Developers (Claude Code):** The full kit including skills, commands, agent files, plugin references, and a CLAUDE.md template.
3. **Teams admin:** Skills that can be provisioned organisation-wide via the Teams admin console.

Every file in the starter kit must include a header comment explaining what it does, how to install it, and any prerequisites.

## Files to Create or Update

### NEW: Session Handoff Skill (`starter-kit/skills/session-handoff/`)

This is a **new deliverable** based on `.planning/research/session-handoff-requirements.md`. It is the most significant new file in the starter kit.

#### Structure

```
starter-kit/skills/session-handoff/
  SKILL.md                                    # Core skill (platform-adaptive)
  references/
    handoff-template-technical.md             # Full structured template for Claude Code
    handoff-template-general.md               # Simplified template for claude.ai/Desktop
    handoff-scenarios.md                      # 5 scenario types with guidance
    context-awareness-guide.md                # Why handoffs matter, when to use them
```

#### `SKILL.md` (Core Skill)

**Purpose:** Guide users through creating session handoff/continuation prompts when they need to preserve context across sessions.

**YAML Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
name: session-handoff
description: |
  WHEN the user wants to hand off a conversation, create a continuation prompt,
  save session progress, wrap up and start fresh, or preserve context before
  a session ends or degrades.
  WHEN NOT the user is simply asking for a summary of the current conversation
  without intending to continue in a new session.
---
```

**Content requirements:**
1. **Scenario detection logic** -- Determine which of the 5 scenario types applies:
   - Planned session boundary (most common -- work at a logical stopping point)
   - Mid-task context overflow (emergency save -- context degrading or compacted)
   - Task delegation / person handoff (handing to a different person or session)
   - Spec/artifact iteration handoff (iterating on a document/deliverable)
   - Multi-workstream handoff (multiple parallel work items at different stages)

2. **Platform-adaptive behaviour:**
   - **Claude Code:** Generate a structured markdown file written to a specified path (default: `.planning/continuation-prompts/session-N-continuation.md`). Include file-reading directives, file tree, git context, subagent parallelisation hints.
   - **claude.ai / Claude Desktop:** Generate a single copy-paste text block. Avoid technical jargon (no tokens, context windows, compaction). Use guided questions: "What were you working on?", "What did you accomplish?", "What do you need to do next?"

3. **Guided question sequence** (adapted per platform):
   - What project/task is this for? (identity)
   - What was accomplished in this session? (progress)
   - What needs to happen next? (objectives)
   - Are there any files the next session must read? (context -- Code only)
   - Are there known issues or blockers? (problems)
   - Is there anything specific the next session must remember? (principles/constraints)

4. **Token-awareness guidance:**
   - 0-50%: Proactive suggestion only; handoff can be brief
   - 50-70%: Gentle awareness; mention that a checkpoint might be worthwhile
   - 70-85%: Active recommendation; be more detailed as context is starting to degrade
   - 85-95%: Urgent capture; focus on essentials only
   - Post-compaction: Recovery mode; help reconstruct what was lost

5. **Output format specification:**
   - For technical users: structured markdown with Project Identity Block, Context Files directive, Cumulative Progress Summary (recency-weighted), Session Objectives, Remaining Work Tracker, Recommended Approach, Data Locations, Open Questions, Success Criteria
   - For general users: single text block with "How to Use This" instruction, plain-language summary of work done, next steps, things to remember

6. **Header comment:**
```markdown

**Header comment:** What this file is, that it is a reference for the session-handoff skill.

#### `references/context-awareness-guide.md`

Brief guide on context window mechanics in plain language:
- Why sessions degrade over time (for non-technical users: analogy-based; for technical: token mechanics)
- When to create a handoff vs use `/compact` vs start fresh
- How to use Projects as a more durable alternative to per-session handoffs
- Signs that a session is degrading (Claude repeating itself, forgetting earlier context, asking about things already discussed)

**Header comment:** What this file is, intended audience.

   - Third-party marketplace plugins: Medium risk. Review content before enabling. Admin approval.
   - Internally developed skills: Low risk. Peer review recommended.
   - Third-party skills (e.g., skills.sh): Medium risk. Admin review of content.
   - MCP/Connector integrations: Medium-High risk. Admin approval. Document data access.
   - Commands: Low risk (Code-only). Peer review.
5. **Risk Assessment Criteria** -- What to check: data access, external connections, code execution, maintenance status, source reputation
6. **Installation and Maintenance:**
   - Plugins installed via marketplace receive automatic updates
   - Files copied manually require periodic review (specify `{{REVIEW_FREQUENCY}}`)
   - Who is responsible for reviewing each category
7. **Roles and Responsibilities** -- Admin (provisions org-wide skills, reviews new tools), Team leads (approve low-risk items, escalate), All staff (follow policy, report concerns)
8. **Data and Privacy Considerations** -- What data may be exposed to extensions, GDPR considerations for UK organisations, safeguarding sector specifics if `{{INDUSTRY}}` includes safeguarding
9. **Review Schedule** -- Policy reviewed every `{{REVIEW_FREQUENCY}}`, triggered review on new extension type or incident
10. **Appendix: Currently Approved Extensions** -- Empty table for the organisation to populate

**Header comment:**
```markdown
<!--
  AI Governance Policy Template
  What: Parameterised governance policy for AI tool extensions (skills, plugins,
        MCPs, commands). Designed for UK SMBs.
  Usage: Replace all {{PLACEHOLDER}} values with your organisation's details.
  Prerequisites: None. This is a standalone document.
  Note: This template uses UK English and references UK regulatory context
        (GDPR, ICO). Adapt regulatory references if used outside the UK.
-->
```

---

### NEW: Example CLAUDE.md Template (`starter-kit/templates/claude-md-template.md`)

**Purpose:** A starter CLAUDE.md file that developers can adapt for their projects.

**Content sections:**
1. **Project** -- One-line description
2. **Tech Stack** -- Language, framework, database, hosting
3. **Dev Commands** -- build, test, lint, deploy (copy-paste ready)
4. **Architecture** -- Brief directory structure, entry points, key files
5. **Code Style** -- Naming conventions, formatting rules, import patterns
6. **Testing** -- How to run tests, patterns to follow, coverage expectations
7. **Environment** -- Required env vars, setup steps
8. **Key Gotchas** -- Non-obvious patterns, common mistakes, things Claude tends to get wrong
9. **Style** -- UK English rule (pre-populated)

Each section should have a brief inline comment explaining what belongs there and what to leave out.

**Header comment:**
```markdown
<!--
  CLAUDE.md Template
  What: Starter template for creating CLAUDE.md files in your projects.
        CLAUDE.md provides Claude Code with project context at session start.
  Usage: Copy this file to the root of your project as CLAUDE.md.
        Fill in the sections relevant to your project, delete the rest.
  Prerequisites: Claude Code installed.
  Tip: Keep CLAUDE.md under ~500 lines. Use it as a map, not an encyclopaedia.
       Point to /docs for detailed documentation.
-->
```

---

### NEW: Docs Structure Template (`starter-kit/templates/docs-structure-template.md`)

**Purpose:** A markdown guide describing the recommended `/docs` directory structure for AI-readable codebases, based on the OpenAI/Reddit approach adapted for Phew!'s maturity level.

**Content:**
```
docs/
  architecture/        # System architecture, domain model, data flow diagrams
  conventions/         # Coding standards, naming patterns, formatting rules
  integrations/        # Third-party service docs (APIs, webhooks, auth flows)
  schemas/             # Database schemas, API schemas, data models
  references/          # LLM-ready external docs (llms.txt files, vendor docs)
```

For each directory:
- What goes in it
- Example files
- How CLAUDE.md should reference it
- Maintenance guidance (who updates it, how often, agent-driven doc gardening)

Explain the progressive disclosure principle: CLAUDE.md points to `/docs`, Claude navigates as needed. This keeps CLAUDE.md lean while ensuring deep context is always accessible.

**Header comment:**
```markdown
<!--
  Docs Structure Template
  What: Recommended /docs directory structure for AI-readable codebases.
        Based on the progressive disclosure principle: CLAUDE.md as map,
        /docs as system of record.
  Usage: Create these directories in your project. Populate progressively.
        Use gsd-codebase-mapper to generate initial content.
  Prerequisites: None (but gsd-codebase-mapper can populate this automatically).
-->
```

### NEW: Session Handoff Prompt Examples (`starter-kit/prompts/`)

Two example handoff documents demonstrating what good handoffs look like.

#### `starter-kit/prompts/example-handoff-general.md`

A completed example showing a non-technical user handing off a content creation project. Written in the simplified format (single copy-paste block). Demonstrates all sections from `handoff-template-general.md` filled in with realistic content.

**Scenario:** A marketing team member working on a series of blog posts about safeguarding technology (contextually appropriate for Phew!'s sector).

**Header comment:**
```markdown
<!--
  Example Session Handoff — General User
  What: A completed example of a session handoff prompt for non-technical users.
        Shows what a good handoff looks like when working in claude.ai
        or Claude Desktop.
  Usage: Reference this as an example when creating your own handoffs.
        The session-handoff skill generates these automatically.
  Prerequisites: None.
-->
```

#### `starter-kit/prompts/example-handoff-technical.md`

A completed example showing a developer handing off a development project. Written in the full structured format. Demonstrates all sections from `handoff-template-technical.md` filled in with realistic content.

**Scenario:** A developer working on a web application feature, mid-way through implementation, with outstanding work items and known issues (contextually appropriate for Phew!'s technology work).

**Header comment:**
```markdown
<!--
  Example Session Handoff — Developer
  What: A completed example of a session handoff prompt for Claude Code users.
        Shows the full structured format with file directives, work tracker,
        and success criteria.
  Usage: Reference this as an example when creating your own handoffs.
        The session-handoff skill generates these automatically.
  Prerequisites: None.
-->
```

#### `starter-kit/prompts/brand-voice-setup-prompt.md`

The copyable prompt from `.planning/research/brand-voice-workflow.md` that kicks off the brand voice documentation process. Packaged as a standalone file users can reference or copy.

> **Canonical source:** The brand voice setup walkthrough and prompt are defined in detail in **spec 1.6 (Brand Voice & UK English)**. The prompt text in this starter kit file must match the version in 1.6 exactly. If the prompt is updated during Phase 2, update it in both locations — or better, have Agent 5 read the prompt from 1.6's build output rather than duplicating it.

**Header comment:**
```markdown
<!--
  Brand Voice Setup Prompt
  What: A prompt to start the brand voice documentation process with Claude.
        Works best with the brand-voice skill loaded.
  Usage: Copy this prompt into a new Claude conversation. Have your brand
        materials ready (examples of on-brand content, existing guidelines).
  Prerequisites: brand-voice skill loaded (recommended but not required).
-->
```

### Files NOT Being Modified

All existing files in `starter-kit/skills/`, `starter-kit/commands/`, `starter-kit/gsd-mapper/`, and `starter-kit/plugins/` are kept as-is. No modifications are required based on the Phase 0 research outputs -- the uk-english skill, brand-review skill, and brand-review command were already updated during Phase 0.

## Content Outline

How the starter kit section appears in the playbook app.

### Section Structure in the App

The starter kit section is a dedicated page/route in the playbook at `/general/starter-kit` and `/developer/starter-kit` (same content, filtered by track). It contains:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - What the starter kit is and why it exists
   - Two ways to get the files: download from this page, or from the repo folder
   - Key distinction: **installing plugins via the marketplace gives automatic updates**; copying raw files means you maintain them manually

2. **File Browser / Download Interface** (primary interactive element)
   - Categorised listing of all starter kit files
   - Each file shows: name, one-line description, track badge (General / Developer / Both), download button
   - Category filters: Skills, Commands, Templates, Prompts, Plugins, GSD Mapper
   - Track filter: Show All / General Only / Developer Only

3. **Installation Guides** (per file type)
   - How to install skills on claude.ai / Claude Desktop (ZIP upload)
   - How to install skills on Claude Code (copy to `.claude/skills/`)
   - How to install skills organisation-wide (Teams admin console)
   - How to install commands on Claude Code (copy to `.claude/commands/`)
   - How to install plugins (marketplace vs manual)
   - How to use templates and prompts (copy and adapt)

4. **Plugin Guidance** (important callout)
   - Explain that plugins in the starter kit are reference copies for review purposes
   - The recommended path: install via the official marketplace for automatic updates
   - For plugins where Phew! prefers not to install: the raw files are provided as a fallback
   - Link to the governance policy (section 1.5) for approval workflows

5. **Quick Start Recommendation** (prioritised adoption order)
   - Week 1: uk-english skill + profile preferences (2 minutes)
   - Week 1: Session handoff skill (upload once, use whenever)
   - Week 2: Brand voice setup (30-60 minute guided session)
   - Week 2: CLAUDE.md template (for dev team)
   - Week 3: Governance policy (team discussion + customisation)
   - Ongoing: Explore additional skills and plugins as needs arise

## Interaction Design

### File Browser Component

The primary interactive element is a file browser that lets users explore, filter, and download starter kit files.

**Component structure:**
```
StarterKitBrowser
  ├── CategoryTabs (shadcn Tabs)
  │   ├── "All" | "Skills" | "Commands" | "Templates" | "Prompts" | "Plugins" | "GSD Mapper"
  │   └── Track toggle within each tab (Show All / General / Developer)
  ├── FileList (for each category)
  │   └── FileCard (shadcn Card, repeated)
  │       ├── File name + one-line description
  │       ├── Track badge (shadcn Badge: "General" / "Developer" / "Both")
  │       ├── Priority badge (shadcn Badge: "Recommended" for high-priority items)
  │       ├── Expand/collapse for details (shadcn Collapsible)
  │       │   ├── Full description
  │       │   ├── Installation instructions (per platform)
  │       │   └── File contents preview (first 20 lines, syntax highlighted)
  │       └── Action buttons
  │           ├── "Download" (downloads the .md file)
  │           ├── "Copy contents" (copies raw text to clipboard)
  │           └── "Copy install command" (for skills/commands with CLI install)
  └── QuickStartGuide (shadcn Alert at top of section)
      └── Prioritised adoption order with links to relevant files
```

**Key interactions:**
- **Category filtering:** Tabs switch between file categories. Active tab highlighted.
- **Track filtering:** Toggle within each tab shows All / General only / Developer only. Current track (from URL) sets the default.
- **File expansion:** Click a file card to expand and see full description, install instructions, and content preview. Uses shadcn Collapsible with Motion animation.
- **Download:** Triggers browser download of the raw `.md` file. For skills with reference files (session-handoff, agent-browser, etc.), download as a ZIP containing the full folder.
- **Copy contents:** Copies the file's raw markdown to clipboard. Uses the `useCopyToClipboard` hook with visual confirmation.
- **Copy install command:** For items with a CLI install step, copies the relevant command. Uses the same copy hook.

### Install Command Copy Buttons

For each file type, provide a copyable install command:

**Skill (Claude Code -- project-level):**
```bash
cp -r path/to/skill-name .claude/skills/skill-name
```

**Skill (Claude Code -- global):**
```bash
cp -r path/to/skill-name ~/.claude/skills/skill-name
```

**Command (Claude Code):**
```bash
cp path/to/command-name.md .claude/commands/command-name.md
```

**Plugin (marketplace install):**
```
claude plugin install plugin-name
```

**Skill (claude.ai/Desktop -- ZIP upload):**
No CLI command. Provide step-by-step instructions:
1. Download the skill ZIP file
2. Open claude.ai (or Claude Desktop) > Settings > Capabilities > Skills
3. Click "Upload skill"
4. Select the downloaded ZIP file
5. The skill will appear in your Skills list and activate automatically

**Skill (Teams admin -- org-wide provisioning):**
1. Download the skill ZIP file
2. Open the Teams admin console
3. Navigate to organisation settings > Skills
4. Upload the skill ZIP
5. Set as enabled-by-default for all users

### Download Packaging

| Content | Download Format | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| Single-file skill (e.g., uk-english) | `.md` file | Direct download |
| Multi-file skill (e.g., session-handoff) | `.zip` containing the full folder | ZIP preserves directory structure |
| Command file | `.md` file | Direct download |
| Template file | `.md` file | Direct download |
| Prompt file | `.md` file | Direct download |
| GSD Mapper (full kit) | `.zip` containing gsd-mapper/ folder | All agent, command, workflow, template files |
| Plugin reference (individual) | `.zip` of the plugin folder | For review; note that marketplace install is preferred |
| Full starter kit | `.zip` of entire starter-kit/ folder | "Download everything" option at top of page |

### Plugin Guidance Callout

A prominent callout (shadcn Alert, variant "default") at the top of the Plugins tab:

> **Plugins vs. raw files**
>
> The plugin files below are reference copies -- they show you exactly what each plugin does so you can review before installing.
>
> **Recommended:** Install plugins via the Claude Code marketplace (`claude plugin install plugin-name`). Marketplace plugins receive automatic updates.
>
> **Alternative:** If you prefer not to install a plugin, you can copy the raw skill/command files from below and maintain them manually. Note that you will not receive updates this way.
>
> See the [Governance Policy](/general/governance) for approval workflows.

## Copyable Content

### Install Commands by Platform

**Set profile preferences (claude.ai / Claude Desktop) -- UK English:**
```
Always use UK English spelling and grammar (e.g., colour, organise, behaviour, centre, analyse). Use UK date format (DD/MM/YYYY) and GBP (£) for currency.
```

**CLAUDE.md UK English rule (Claude Code) -- add to any project:**
```markdown
- **UK English throughout.** All output must use UK English spelling and grammar (e.g., colour, organise, behaviour, centre, analyse). Use UK date format (DD/MM/YYYY) and GBP (£) for currency.
```

**Install a skill globally (Claude Code):**
```bash
cp -r starter-kit/skills/skill-name ~/.claude/skills/skill-name
```

**Install a skill per-project (Claude Code):**
```bash
cp -r starter-kit/skills/skill-name .claude/skills/skill-name
```

**Install a command (Claude Code):**
```bash
cp starter-kit/commands/command-name.md .claude/commands/command-name.md
```

**Install the GSD codebase mapper (Claude Code):**
```bash
# Copy all mapper files to your project
cp -r starter-kit/gsd-mapper/agent .claude/agents/
cp -r starter-kit/gsd-mapper/command .claude/commands/
cp -r starter-kit/gsd-mapper/workflow .claude/workflows/
cp -r starter-kit/gsd-mapper/templates .claude/templates/
```

**Install a plugin from the marketplace (Claude Code):**
```bash
claude plugin install <plugin-name>
```

**Brand voice setup prompt (copy-paste into any Claude conversation):**
```
I'd like to create a comprehensive brand voice document for our company. Please guide me through the process step by step, covering all seven areas:

1. Brand Personality
2. Voice Attributes (3-5 attributes with "we are / we are not / sounds like" definitions)
3. Audience Awareness
4. Core Messaging Pillars
5. Tone Spectrum (how our voice adapts across channels and situations)
6. Style Rules (grammar, formatting, punctuation decisions)
7. Terminology (preferred terms, product names, inclusive language)

Here's what I can share to start:

**Company:** [Company name]
**What we do:** [Brief description]
**Who we serve:** [Primary audience]

**Examples of content that sounds like us:**
[Paste 2-3 examples of on-brand content — website copy, emails, social posts]

**Examples of content that does NOT sound like us (if available):**
[Paste any examples that felt off-brand]

**Existing guidelines (if any):**
[Paste or describe any existing brand/style guidelines]

Please work through each section one at a time, asking me questions and presenting options before moving to the next. When we're done, compile everything into a single brand voice document I can save and reuse.
```

## Two-Track Considerations

### General Track Users

**What they see:**
- Skills: uk-english, session-handoff, brand-voice, brand-review, brainstorming, writing-plans, writing-skills, proposal-writer, file-organizer, markdown-converter, canvas-design
- Templates: governance-policy.md
- Prompts: example-handoff-general.md, brand-voice-setup-prompt.md
- Installation guides focus on ZIP upload (Settings > Capabilities) and admin provisioning
- No commands, plugins, or GSD mapper content
- No CLI commands -- all instructions are GUI-based

**Tone:** Practical, jargon-free. "Upload this file" not "install this skill to your local skills directory." Focus on what each skill does and when to use it, not how it works internally.

### Developer Track Users

**What they see:**
- Everything General users see, PLUS:
- Commands: brand-review
- Templates: claude-md-template.md, docs-structure-template.md
- Prompts: example-handoff-technical.md
- GSD codebase mapper (full kit)
- Plugin reference copies (all 14)
- Installation guides include CLI commands alongside GUI instructions
- File content previews with syntax highlighting

**Tone:** Technical but not dense. Show file paths, CLI commands, and directory structures. Developers can see the raw file contents and understand the structure.

### Shared Content

Both tracks see:
- The Quick Start recommendation (prioritised adoption order)
- The "Plugins vs raw files" distinction
- The governance policy link
- The "Download everything" option

## Implementation Notes for Build Agent

### Data Structure

Define starter kit content as typed TypeScript objects in `app/src/content/starter-kit/`. Each file entry should include:

```typescript
interface StarterKitFile {
  id: string;                          // Unique identifier (e.g., 'skill-uk-english')
  name: string;                        // Display name
  description: string;                 // One-line description
  longDescription: string;             // Full description (shown on expand)
  category: 'skill' | 'command' | 'template' | 'prompt' | 'plugin' | 'gsd-mapper';
  tracks: ('general' | 'developer')[]; // Which tracks this file appears in
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'; // Adoption priority
  filePath: string;                    // Path relative to starter-kit/
  isMultiFile: boolean;                // Whether this is a folder (needs ZIP download)
  installInstructions: {
    claudeCode?: string;               // CLI install command or steps
    claudeDesktop?: string;            // GUI install steps
    claudeAi?: string;                 // GUI install steps
    teamsAdmin?: string;               // Admin provisioning steps
  };
  pluginRecommendation?: 'install-marketplace' | 'install-if-needed' | 'reference-only';
  rawContent?: string;                 // File contents for preview and copy (loaded lazily)
}
```

### File Serving

The actual `.md` files from `starter-kit/` need to be served for download. Two approaches:

1. **Build-time bundling:** During the Vite build, copy starter-kit files to `public/starter-kit/` so they are served as static assets. Download links point to `/starter-kit/path/to/file.md`.

2. **Content embedding:** For single files, embed the raw content in the TypeScript data objects and generate downloads client-side using `Blob` + `URL.createObjectURL()`. For multi-file ZIPs, use a lightweight ZIP library (e.g., `fflate` or `jszip`) to generate ZIPs client-side.

**Recommendation:** Use approach 1 (static assets) for simplicity. Copy the `starter-kit/` directory to `public/` during build. This avoids bundling large files into JavaScript and keeps downloads fast.

### ZIP Generation

For multi-file downloads (skills with reference folders, the GSD mapper kit, the full starter kit), generate ZIPs either:
- At build time using a Vite plugin or build script
- At serve time using a small client-side ZIP library

Build-time ZIP generation is simpler and more reliable. A small build script can create the necessary ZIP files and place them in `public/downloads/`.
