# Spec 1.6 — Brand Voice & UK English

> **Phase 2 build agent:** Agent 3 — Skills, Extensions, Governance & Brand
> **Track:** Both (General focus on claude.ai/Desktop setup; Developer focus on CLAUDE.md rules, Britfix hook, CI integration)

## Purpose

Walk users through two related capabilities:

1. **Brand voice setup** — Using the brand-voice skill to create a comprehensive brand voice document for Phew! (or any organisation), then using the brand-review skill/command to check content against it on an ongoing basis.

2. **UK English enforcement** — A layered approach ensuring Claude always outputs UK English, covering all Claude surfaces (claude.ai, Claude Desktop, Claude Code).

The section should make clear that these are complementary: UK English enforcement is a quick, lightweight win (two minutes to set up); brand voice is a deeper exercise (30–60 minutes) that also encompasses language conventions as part of the broader brand standard.

**Cross-dependency:** This section is built by the same Phase 2 agent (Agent 3) as sections 1.4 (Skills, Extensions & the Decision Tree) and 1.5 (AI Governance Policy). The governance policy in 1.5 references the brand-voice and uk-english skills as examples in its register template. The decision tree in 1.4 covers what skills are and when to use them — this section (1.6) is a concrete, worked example of skills in action. The agent should ensure the terminology and skill descriptions are consistent across all three sections.

## Content Outline

The section is divided into two halves, presented sequentially, with UK English first (quick win) and brand voice second (deeper exercise).

### Part 1: UK English Enforcement

#### 1A. Introduction
- "Claude defaults to US English because its training data is predominantly American. There is no global switch — but it takes two minutes to fix, and you will never have to think about it again."
- Layered approach overview: profile preferences + project instructions + CLAUDE.md rule + optional skill

#### 1B. For claude.ai and Claude Desktop Users (General Track)
Three steps, presented as a numbered walkthrough:

**Step 1: Set profile preferences** (30 seconds, one-time)
- Navigate to: claude.ai > click your initials (bottom-left) > Settings > Profile
- Add to the preferences text box:
  ```
  Always use UK English spelling and grammar (e.g., colour, organise, behaviour, centre, analyse). Use UK date format (DD/MM/YYYY) and GBP (£) for currency.
  ```
- Screenshot-style visual showing where to find this setting
- Note: this applies to every conversation automatically, on both claude.ai and Claude Desktop

**Step 2: Add project instruction** (30 seconds per project)
- For any shared claude.ai Project, add to Custom Instructions:
  ```
  Always use UK English spelling and grammar in all responses.
  ```
- This is the closest thing to an "admin-enforced" setting — the project owner sets it once and all team members inherit it

**Step 3: Upload the UK English skill** (optional belt-and-braces)
- The starter kit includes a UK English skill file at `starter-kit/skills/uk-english/SKILL.md`
- Upload via:
  - **Teams admin console** (recommended — provisions to all users automatically)
  - **claude.ai:** Upload to a Project
  - **Claude Desktop:** Settings > Capabilities > Skills (ZIP format)
- The skill contains comprehensive rules covering spelling, grammar, formatting, and code contexts
- Walk through the upload process step by step

#### 1C. For Claude Code Users (Developer Track)
Two steps:

**Step 1: CLAUDE.md rule** (30 seconds, essential)
- Add to every project's CLAUDE.md under a "Style" or "Critical Rules" heading:
  ```markdown
  ## Style

  - **UK English throughout.** All output must use UK English spelling and grammar (e.g., colour, organise, behaviour, centre, analyse). Use UK date format (DD/MM/YYYY) and GBP (£) for currency.
  ```
- Note: this is version-controlled — it ships with the repo, so all developers get it automatically
- Note: this is already in place in the current project's CLAUDE.md

**Step 2: Britfix hook** (advanced, if issues persist)
- An open-source post-processing hook that automatically converts US English to UK English in files written by Claude Code
- GitHub: `github.com/Talieisin/britfix`
- Context-aware: only converts comments and docstrings, never identifiers or string literals
- Configuration for `.claude/settings.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "hooks": {
      "PostToolUse": [
        {
          "matcher": "Write|Edit",
          "hooks": [
            {
              "type": "command",
              "command": "/absolute/path/to/britfix/run-hook.sh",
              "timeout": 10
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
- Frame as: "the CLAUDE.md rule handles 95% of cases. If you find persistent issues in a particular project, Britfix catches the rest automatically."
- Cross-reference to Section 1.5 (Governance Policy): Britfix is a Tier 2 extension (hook that modifies files automatically) — follow the approval process

#### 1D. The UK English Skill — What It Contains
- Display the full content of `starter-kit/skills/uk-english/SKILL.md` in a collapsible, syntax-highlighted block with copy button
- Highlight key rules: -ise/-ize, -our/-or, -re/-er, collective nouns, date formats, code context rules
- Note: in code contexts, UK English applies only to comments, documentation, and user-facing strings — never to variable names, function names, or CSS properties

---

### Part 2: Brand Voice Setup

#### 2A. Introduction
- "UK English is about language mechanics. Brand voice is about personality — how your organisation sounds, what it stands for, and how it adapts across different contexts."
- The brand-voice skill provides a structured framework for documenting your brand voice through a guided conversation with Claude
- Once documented, the brand-review skill/command checks content against your brand voice document

#### 2B. What to Prepare Before Starting
- **Minimum required:** A willingness to make decisions about how the brand communicates. No prior documentation is strictly necessary.
- **Strongly recommended:**
  - 2–3 examples of on-brand content (website copy, marketing emails, social posts that "sound right")
  - A basic understanding of the target audience
  - Known terminology preferences (product names, industry terms)
- **Nice to have:**
  - Existing brand style guide or tone of voice document
  - Examples of off-brand content
  - Competitor examples
- **For Phew! specifically:** Note that the website scrape has already captured brand-relevant content that could seed the conversation — IMPACT values, tone observations, sector terminology. Present this as "a head start" that Phew! can bring to the setup conversation.

#### 2C. The Seven Framework Sections
Present each section of the brand-voice skill framework as an accordion item with a brief explanation:

| # | Section | What It Covers |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 1 | Brand Personality | Defining the brand as if it were a person |
| 2 | Voice Attributes | 3–5 defining communication attributes with "we are / we are not" definitions |
| 3 | Audience Awareness | Who the brand speaks to, their expertise, expectations |
| 4 | Core Messaging Pillars | 3–5 key themes the brand consistently communicates |
| 5 | Tone Spectrum | How the voice adapts across channels and situations |
| 6 | Style Rules | Grammar, formatting, punctuation decisions (includes UK English) |
| 7 | Terminology | Preferred/avoided terms, product names, inclusive language |

For each, provide a one-paragraph explanation and an illustrative example relevant to Phew! or a similar SMB.

#### 2D. Copyable Prompt to Kick Off the Setup
The following prompt starts the brand voice documentation process. It should be presented in a prominent card with a copy button.

```
I'd like to create a comprehensive brand voice document for our company. Please guide me through the process step by step, covering all seven areas:

1. Brand Personality
2. Voice Attributes (3-5 attributes with "we are / we are not / sounds like" definitions)
3. Audience Awareness
4. Core Messaging Pillars
5. Tone Spectrum (how our voice adapts across channels and situations)
6. Style Rules (grammar, formatting, punctuation decisions)
7. Terminology (preferred terms, product names, inclusive language)

Here's what I can share to start:

**Company:** [Company name]
**What we do:** [Brief description]
**Who we serve:** [Primary audience]

**Examples of content that sounds like us:**
[Paste 2-3 examples of on-brand content — website copy, emails, social posts]

**Examples of content that does NOT sound like us (if available):**
[Paste any examples that felt off-brand]

**Existing guidelines (if any):**
[Paste or describe any existing brand/style guidelines]

Please work through each section one at a time, asking me questions and presenting options before moving to the next. When we're done, compile everything into a single brand voice document I can save and reuse.
```

Note: the brand-voice skill must be loaded in the environment for best results. On claude.ai/Desktop, upload it as a skill or add to project knowledge. On Claude Code, save to `.claude/skills/` or `~/.claude/skills/`.

#### 2E. Where to Save the Brand Voice Document
Once the conversation produces a brand voice document, the user needs to save it where Claude can access it in future sessions:

| Environment | Where to Store | How It Works |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Claude Desktop / claude.ai** | Project knowledge file | Add the document to a project's knowledge base. Claude loads it automatically for all conversations in that project. |
| **Claude Code** | Skill file in `~/.claude/skills/` or project skills directory | Claude loads skill files into context automatically when relevant. |
| **Claude Code** | Referenced in `CLAUDE.md` | Add a reference to the brand voice file location so Claude knows where to find it. |
| **Any environment** | Pasted into conversation | The user can paste the document at the start of any session. Least efficient but always works. |

Emphasise that the brand voice document is a **living document** — review it when the brand evolves, messaging changes, or new products launch.

#### 2F. Using Brand Review for Ongoing Content Checking
- Brand-review is available as both a **skill** (`starter-kit/skills/brand-review/SKILL.md`) and a **command** (`starter-kit/commands/brand-review.md`)
- **In Claude Code:** Invoke with `/brand-review`
- **In claude.ai / Claude Desktop:** Ask naturally — "Review this content against our brand guidelines" or "Check this blog post against our brand voice document"
- What brand-review checks: voice and tone, terminology and language, messaging pillars, style guide compliance (including UK English), legal/compliance flags
- Output: summary, detailed findings table (severity: High/Medium/Low), revised sections, legal/compliance flags

**Session management tip:** "Claude gives you better feedback when it has room to think. If you have spent a long conversation creating content, start a fresh session for the review — load your brand voice document, paste the content, and ask for a review."

#### 2G. The Brand-Review Skill/Command — What It Contains
- Display the full content of `starter-kit/skills/brand-review/SKILL.md` in a collapsible, syntax-highlighted block with copy button
- Highlight the key review dimensions: Voice and Tone, Terminology and Language, Messaging Pillars, Style Guide Compliance, Legal/Compliance Flags
- Note that brand-review also works without a brand voice document — it falls back to a generic review for clarity, consistency, and professionalism

### Part 3: How It All Fits Together

A visual summary showing the relationship between the tools:

```
QUICK WIN (2 minutes)              DEEPER EXERCISE (30-60 minutes)
UK English enforcement             Brand voice documentation
├─ Profile preferences             ├─ brand-voice skill (framework)
├─ Project instructions            ├─ Guided conversation
├─ CLAUDE.md rule                  ├─ Brand voice document (output)
└─ UK English skill (belt+braces)  └─ brand-review (ongoing checks)
                                       └─ also catches UK English issues
```

Key message: Start with the quick win today. Plan the brand voice exercise for a team session in the next fortnight.

## Interaction Design

### Layout
- Two-part layout: "UK English" section followed by "Brand Voice" section, separated by a clear visual divider
- Each part uses accordion panels for sub-sections
- Prominent "copy" buttons on all code blocks, configuration snippets, and the setup prompt
- The brand-voice setup prompt gets a distinctive card treatment — larger, visually prominent, with a clear call-to-action

### Skill File Display
- The full text of `starter-kit/skills/uk-english/SKILL.md` and `starter-kit/skills/brand-review/SKILL.md` should be renderable as collapsible blocks with syntax highlighting (Shiki, markdown language) and copy buttons
- Default state: collapsed, with a "View full skill file" toggle
- When expanded, the code block should scroll independently of the page

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough
- The UK English setup steps should be presented as a numbered stepper or numbered card sequence
- Each step should show the expected time commitment ("30 seconds", "2 minutes")
- Completion indicators (optional): users can mentally check off each step

### Platform Tabs
- Where instructions differ by platform (claude.ai vs Claude Desktop vs Claude Code), use shadcn `Tabs` to switch between platform-specific instructions
- General track: only show claude.ai and Claude Desktop tabs
- Developer track: show all three tabs (claude.ai, Claude Desktop, Claude Code)

---

## Copyable Content

All of the following must be presented with copy-to-clipboard buttons:

### 1. Profile Preferences Text (claude.ai / Claude Desktop)
```
Always use UK English spelling and grammar (e.g., colour, organise, behaviour, centre, analyse). Use UK date format (DD/MM/YYYY) and GBP (£) for currency.
```

### 2. Project Instruction Text (claude.ai Projects)
```
Always use UK English spelling and grammar in all responses.
```

### 3. CLAUDE.md Snippet (Claude Code)
```markdown
## Style

- **UK English throughout.** All output must use UK English spelling and grammar (e.g., colour, organise, behaviour, centre, analyse). Use UK date format (DD/MM/YYYY) and GBP (£) for currency.
```

### 4. Britfix Hook Configuration (Claude Code, Advanced)
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/absolute/path/to/britfix/run-hook.sh",
            "timeout": 10
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 5. Brand Voice Setup Prompt

Please work through each section one at a time, asking me questions and presenting options before moving to the next. When we're done, compile everything into a single brand voice document I can save and reuse.
```

### 6. UK English Skill File Content
The full content of `starter-kit/skills/uk-english/SKILL.md` (reproduced here for the build agent's reference — the agent should read the actual file and render it in the app):

```markdown
---
name: uk-english
description: Enforce UK English spelling, grammar, and conventions in all output. Use when writing, reviewing, or editing any content for UK audiences.
---

# UK English

All output must use UK English spelling, grammar, and conventions.

## Spelling Rules

Use British English spellings throughout:
- -ise endings (not -ize): organise, recognise, specialise, optimise
- -our endings (not -or): colour, behaviour, favour, honour
- -re endings (not -er): centre, metre, theatre (except for computer-related "center" in CSS/code)
- -ence endings where applicable: licence (noun), defence, offence
- Double L: travelling, modelling, labelling, cancelled
- Other: grey (not gray), programme (not program, unless computer program), cheque (not check, for banking)

## Grammar Conventions

- Collective nouns may take plural verbs: "the team are working on..."
- "Whilst", "amongst", "towards" are preferred over "while", "among", "toward"
- Past tense: "learnt", "spelt", "dreamt" are acceptable alongside "learned", "spelled", "dreamed"

## Formatting Conventions

- Dates: DD/MM/YYYY or DD Month YYYY (e.g., 14/02/2026 or 14 February 2026)
- Currency: GBP, use £ symbol (e.g., £500, not $500)
- Time: 24-hour format preferred in formal contexts (e.g., 14:00), 12-hour acceptable informally (e.g., 2pm -- no space, no full stops in am/pm)
- Quotation marks: single quotes for primary quotation, double quotes for quotes within quotes
- Full stops and commas go outside closing quotation marks unless part of the quoted material

## In Code Contexts

- Use UK English only in comments, documentation, and user-facing strings
- Never change variable names, function names, CSS properties, or API parameters (these follow their language's conventions, typically US English)
- Example: write `// Initialise the colour palette` but keep `const color = getColor()`
```

### 7. Brand-Review Skill File Content
The full content of `starter-kit/skills/brand-review/SKILL.md` — the build agent should read the actual file at `starter-kit/skills/brand-review/SKILL.md` and render it in a collapsible code block in the app. The content is approximately 120 lines covering: inputs, review process (with and without brand guidelines), legal/compliance flags, output format, and post-review actions.

---

## Two-Track Considerations

### General Track

**UK English:**
- Show only the claude.ai and Claude Desktop setup steps (Steps 1–3 from Section 1B)
- Hide the CLAUDE.md and Britfix sections entirely
- Emphasis: "This takes two minutes and you will never think about it again"
- Present the UK English skill as something the Teams admin uploads once for everyone

**Brand Voice:**
- Full walkthrough of all seven framework sections with examples
- The setup prompt is the primary call-to-action — "Copy this prompt, open Claude Desktop, and paste it in"
- Emphasise that no technical skills are needed — Claude guides the conversation
- For brand-review: show only the natural language invocation ("Review this content against our brand guidelines")
- Suggest a team session: "This works best when a few people contribute — book 45 minutes with whoever knows the brand best"
- Session management tip about starting a fresh session for reviews

**Storage guidance:**
- Focus on "add to a Project" as the primary storage mechanism (most intuitive for non-dev users)
- Mention admin-provisioned skill deployment as the scalable option

### Developer Track

**UK English:**
- Show all setup options: profile preferences, project instructions, CLAUDE.md rule, UK English skill, and Britfix hook
- The CLAUDE.md snippet is the primary recommendation — "If you do nothing else, add this one line"
- Britfix hook: full configuration details, governance note (Tier 2 extension), and honest assessment ("handles the 5% the CLAUDE.md rule misses")
- Note: in code contexts, UK English applies to comments and docs only — never change API names, CSS properties, or variable names

**Brand Voice:**
- Same walkthrough as general track, plus:
  - Show the brand-voice SKILL.md file structure as an example of well-written skill design (cross-reference to 1.4 decision tree)
  - Show the brand-review command file (`starter-kit/commands/brand-review.md`) with `/brand-review` invocation syntax
  - Note the difference: skill version for claude.ai/Desktop (natural language), command version for Claude Code (slash command)
  - Governance angle: both skills are Tier 1 (internal, read-only, no external data access) — log them in the register per Section 1.5

**Storage guidance:**
- Focus on `~/.claude/skills/` for personal skills and `.claude/skills/` for project skills
- Show how to reference the brand voice document in CLAUDE.md
- Note that skill files are version-controlled via git

---
