# Spec 1.1 — Welcome & Orientation

> **Phase 2 build agent:** Agent 6 — Welcome, Process Doc & Integration Content
> **Track:** Both (this is the landing page)

## Purpose

This is the first thing Phew! staff see when they open the playbook. It must immediately answer three questions: "What is this?", "Why does it exist?", and "How do I use it?" It introduces the two-track structure, lets the user choose their path, and sets the tone for the entire experience — practical, non-condescending, and grounded in the training they already attended. It also establishes the meta-narrative (this deliverable was built using the exact tools and workflows it describes) and introduces the persistent feedback mechanism.

## Content Outline

### Hero / Opening Block

A clean, welcoming header area — not a traditional "hero" with a background image, but a typographically strong opening that immediately communicates what this is.

**Headline:** "Your AI Playbook" (or similar — short, direct, no jargon)

**Subheading (1–2 lines):** Position this as the follow-up to the training sessions delivered on 11 Feb 2026. Directly address the feedback: this is the summary, cheat-sheet, and reference guide the team asked for.

**Specific talking points for the opening copy (2–3 short paragraphs max):**
- Following the AI training sessions with your team, we put together this interactive playbook as a practical reference — the kind of take-away material you asked for.
- It covers the core topics from the training (context management, skills, session handling, governance) plus developer-specific guidance for the dev team.
- Everything here is designed to be immediately usable. Prompts, templates, and code examples all have a copy button — take what you need and use it straight away.

**Tone calibration:** Warm but not overly casual. Avoid starting with "Welcome to your AI journey" or similar cliches. Speak to Phew! as a capable team that has already had the training — this is a tool, not a tutorial from scratch.

### How to Use This Playbook

A brief orientation section (3–5 bullet points or a short paragraph) explaining the structure:

- **Two tracks:** The playbook is organised into a General track (for everyone using Claude via claude.ai or Claude Desktop) and a Developer track (for the dev team using Claude Code). You can switch tracks at any time.
- **Copy-to-clipboard:** Every prompt, template, and code example has a copy button. Take what you need and paste it directly into Claude.
- **Start anywhere:** You do not need to read this front-to-back. Each section is self-contained. If you already know what you are looking for, jump straight there.
- **Feedback:** If something is unclear, missing, or you want more detail on a topic, there is a feedback button available on every page.

### Track Selector

The primary interactive element on this page. Presents two clear options:

**Option A — "I use Claude in the browser or desktop app"**
- Subtext: "General track — context management, skills, governance, brand voice, and more"
- Routes to: `/general`

**Option B — "I use Claude Code for development"**
- Subtext: "Developer track — CLAUDE.md files, documentation structure, testing, plugins, and more"
- Routes to: `/developer`

**Design requirements:**
- The two options should be visually distinct, clearly selectable, and feel like a genuine choice — not a form field. Use shadcn Card components with hover/focus states.
- Neither option should feel "lesser" — both tracks have substantial content.
- Include a note beneath: "Not sure? Start with the General track — it covers the fundamentals that apply to everyone. You can switch to the Developer track at any time."
- Selecting a track navigates the user to that track's first section. The track can be changed at any time via the navigation.

### How This Was Built (Meta-Narrative)

A short, clearly-delineated section (possibly a shadcn Alert or a visually distinct callout block — not a Card nested in a Card) that explains the meta-narrative.

**Talking points:**
- This playbook was built using the exact tools and workflows it describes.
- The content was planned and researched using Claude with structured prompts and session handoffs (the same techniques covered in the training).
- The app was built by parallel Claude Code agents — each working from a detailed spec, the same pattern described in the Developer track.
- Skills, CLAUDE.md files, and the governance principles described in this playbook were used throughout its creation.
- The point: these are not theoretical techniques. They are the same workflows that produced this deliverable.

**Tone:** Matter-of-fact, not boastful. The meta-narrative should feel like an interesting aside, not a sales pitch. Keep it to 3–4 sentences.

### Feedback

A brief introduction to the feedback mechanism:

- "Spotted something that could be clearer? Want more detail on a specific topic? Use the feedback button — it is available on every page."
- Explain that feedback goes directly to Liam (the trainer) and will be used to improve the playbook.
- Do not over-explain the mechanism. A single sentence plus a visible button is sufficient.

**Implementation note:** The feedback widget itself is built by Agent 1 (App Shell). This section simply introduces it and ensures users know it exists. The build agent for 1.1 should include a placeholder or reference where the feedback button appears, but the actual widget component comes from the shared components.

### What's Covered (Optional Quick Overview)

A lightweight overview of the playbook's content — not a full table of contents, but enough to help users orient themselves. This could be a two-column layout (General | Developer) showing 3–4 key topic areas per track.

**General track highlights:**
- How context works (interactive simulator)
- Session management and handoff prompts
- Skills, extensions, and the decision tree
- AI governance policy
- Brand voice and UK English

**Developer track highlights:**
- CLAUDE.md files and documentation structure
- Codebase mapping with AI agents
- Avoiding hallucinations and quick-fix patterns
- AI-driven testing
- MCP and plugin recommendations

**Design note:** This should be scannable, not dense. Use icons or subtle visual markers to differentiate topics. Do not repeat the full section titles — paraphrase into plain language.

### Quick Reference Card (Downloadable)

A single-page, printable quick-reference card summarising the most important takeaways from the playbook. This directly addresses the training feedback requesting "a summary document or cheat-sheet highlighting the core techniques."

**Content (both tracks combined, one page):**
- **Context management:** 3 rules of thumb for when to start a fresh session
- **Session handoff:** The one-line prompt to get Claude to write its own handoff
- **Skills:** What they are, how to add one (one sentence per platform)
- **UK English:** The quickest enforcement method per platform
- **For developers:** CLAUDE.md in 3 bullet points, the `/plugin install` starter set

**Presentation in the app:**
- A prominent "Download Quick Reference (PDF)" button in the Welcome section, below the track selector
- Also available from the Starter Kit section (1.16)
- The card itself is a styled, single-page document — not a plain markdown file. Use clean typography matching the playbook's design language.

**Implementation note:** The build agent should create this as a downloadable asset (PDF or print-friendly HTML page). Content should be finalised during Phase 3 integration once all sections are written, but the layout and download mechanism should be built in Phase 2.

## Interaction Design

### Components Used

| Component | Source | Usage |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `Card` | shadcn/ui | Track selector options (two cards side-by-side on desktop, stacked on mobile) |
| `Button` | shadcn/ui | Track selection CTA within each card, feedback button |
| `Alert` | shadcn/ui | Meta-narrative callout block |
| `Badge` | shadcn/ui | "General" and "Developer" labels on track cards |
| `Separator` | shadcn/ui | Visual divider between sections |

### Layout

- **Mobile (< 640px):** Single column. Track selector cards stack vertically. All content flows in reading order.
- **Tablet (640px–1023px):** Track selector cards sit side-by-side. Content remains single-column.
- **Desktop (1024px+):** Track selector cards side-by-side with generous padding. "What's Covered" section uses a two-column layout. Max content width: 65ch for body text.

### Track Selector Interaction

1. **Default state:** Both cards are visible, neither is selected.
2. **Hover (desktop):** Subtle elevation increase (shadow or border highlight). Use Tailwind transitions, not Motion.
3. **Focus (keyboard):** Visible `:focus-visible` ring (2–3px, offset, 3:1 contrast minimum).
4. **Active/press:** Brief scale transform (98–99%).
5. **Selection:** Clicking/tapping a card navigates to the chosen track's route (`/general` or `/developer`) using React Router.

### Animation / Motion

- **Page entrance:** Subtle fade-in on the hero text and track selector. Use Motion `AnimatePresence` with a short duration (300–500ms). Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` — fall back to instant render.
- **Track card hover:** CSS transition only (Tailwind `transition-shadow duration-200`).
- **No scroll-triggered animations.** This is a short landing page; scroll animations would be gratuitous.

### Responsive Navigation

The welcome page should display the main navigation (hamburger on mobile, horizontal on desktop), but the track selector on this page is the primary navigation call-to-action. Once a track is selected, the sidebar/nav should reflect the chosen track's section list.

## Copyable Content

There is no copyable prompt or template content on the Welcome page. This section is purely navigational and orientational. All copyable content lives in the track-specific sections.

## Two-Track Considerations

This is the page where the user chooses their track, so both audiences see identical content. The only track-specific elements are:

- The track selector itself, which clearly describes what each track contains.
- The "What's Covered" overview, which shows both tracks' highlights in parallel.
- The note beneath the track selector ("Not sure? Start with the General track...") which gently guides unsure users towards the more accessible starting point.

**Post-selection behaviour:** Once a track is chosen, the welcome page should still be accessible from the nav (e.g., a logo/home link). If a user returns to the welcome page after selecting a track, their previous selection should not be remembered on this page — it should present both options fresh. Track state is managed by the URL, not stored locally.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The page loads as the default route (`/`) with no track pre-selected.
2. The headline and introductory copy clearly explain what the playbook is and why it exists, referencing the Phew! training sessions.
3. Two track selector cards are displayed, each with a clear label, description, and visual identity (badge or colour distinction).
4. Selecting a track navigates to the correct route (`/general` or `/developer`) using React Router.
5. The "Not sure?" guidance text is visible beneath the track selector.
6. The meta-narrative section is visually distinct (Alert or callout) and mentions that the playbook was built with Claude Code agents, skills, and the same workflows it describes.
7. The feedback mechanism is introduced with a visible button or link. The button triggers the shared feedback widget (built by Agent 1).
8. The "What's Covered" overview displays both tracks' key topics in a scannable format.
9. All body text is at least 16px (1rem) with a maximum line length of 65ch.
10. The page is fully responsive: track cards stack on mobile (< 640px), sit side-by-side on tablet+.
11. Keyboard navigation works throughout: Tab moves between track cards, Enter/Space selects, focus indicators are visible.
12. All interactive elements have the 8 required states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error, success — where applicable; loading/error/success may not apply to static cards but focus, hover, and active must be present).
13. The page respects `prefers-reduced-motion` — entrance animations fall back to instant render.
14. No copyable content blocks appear on this page (copy-to-clipboard buttons are introduced conceptually but not used here).
15. UK English is used throughout all copy (spelling, grammar, date formats).
16. The page does not use any "AI slop" design patterns: no glassmorphism, no gradient text, no identical card grids with icon+heading+text, no neon accents.
17. Semantic HTML is used: proper heading hierarchy (h1 for headline, h2 for subsections), landmark elements (`<main>`, `<nav>`), skip link present.
18. Touch targets on track cards and buttons are at least 44px.
19. The page loads without any dependencies on other sections' data or components (aside from the shared layout/nav from Agent 1).
