## 9. Brand Voice and Tone Observations

### Overall Tone

Phew's brand voice is **professional yet approachable**, with a strong undercurrent of **purpose and social mission**. The copy consistently bridges the gap between technical competence and emotional engagement.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Purpose-led language:** Frequent references to "making a real difference," "saving lives," and "social impact." The safeguarding mission is woven into everything, not treated as an afterthought. This is not just a software company -- it is a company driven by the belief that its tools contribute to child safety.

2. **Warm and human:** Uses first-person plural ("we," "our") extensively. Team members are described as "thinkers, makers and explorers." The company resists being "faceless" and emphasises being "an extension of your team." Staff are called out by first name in blog posts.

3. **Confident without being aggressive:** Uses phrases like "market leading," "world class," "pioneering," and "industry-leading" but balances them with collaborative language ("working with," "supporting," "enabling"). The confidence is earned-credential-based (ISO certifications, quantified results) rather than aspirational.

4. **Data-driven claims:** Results are presented with specific percentages and numbers (630% increase, 95% reduction, 14,000 additional admissions). The copy favours proof points over vague benefit statements.

5. **Sector fluency:** The language demonstrates deep familiarity with safeguarding terminology (Sections 11, 175/157, KCSIE, Prevent Duty, multi-agency, ADASS). This positions Phew as an insider, not a vendor looking in from outside.

6. **Educational content marketing:** The blog produces regular thought-leadership content about safeguarding practice, accessibility standards, and public sector digital transformation. Titles are practical and benefit-oriented ("Transform your safeguarding training with a Learning Management System").

7. **Inclusive and empathetic:** Values language emphasises being "mindful," acknowledging "every voice," and having "empathy for their community's challenges."

### Copy Patterns

- Headlines tend to be outcome-focused rather than feature-focused
- Blog posts use a semi-formal, authoritative but accessible register
- Product descriptions lead with the sector problem, then present the solution
- Case studies emphasise quantified impact rather than implementation details
- The exclamation mark in "Phew!" appears occasionally in informal contexts but the brand generally presents as "Phew" without it

### Tagline / Positioning Lines Observed

- "Sector-Specific Digital Products | Safeguarding Systems" (homepage title)
- "Thinkers, makers and explorers"
- "Making a real difference"

## 12. Research Notes and Gaps

### What was well-documented

- Services and product descriptions are thorough and public
- Compliance and certifications are prominently displayed
- Case studies with quantified impact data are published
- Values (IMPACT) and vision are publicly stated
- Blog content is regular and substantial (thought leadership)

### Gaps and areas for follow-up

1. **Full team listing:** The team page (https://www.phew.org.uk/about-phew/the-team/) likely contains a full roster with photos and bios, but individual names and roles beyond Matthew (MD), Salma (Business Support Manager), and Andrew (Developer) were not fully extractable from search results alone. A direct scrape of the team page would complete this.

2. **Full client list:** Beyond the named case studies, the total client base is described in aggregate (100+ audit clients, 60+ website clients) but a comprehensive list is not publicly available.

3. **Pricing information:** No pricing is publicly visible on the website. Products may be available via G-Cloud pricing schedules on the Digital Marketplace, or are likely quoted on enquiry.

4. **Revenue and financial data:** Not publicly disclosed on the website. Companies House filings may contain this information.

5. **Technology stack depth:** The full stack beyond WordPress, ASP.NET, C#, and HL7 is not publicly detailed. Career postings and RocketReach suggest approximately 20 technologies in use.

6. **Competitor positioning:** Phew does not appear to publicly name competitors or provide comparison content. Their differentiation is implied through sector specialism rather than head-to-head comparisons.

7. **eLearning content library:** It is unclear whether Phew provides pre-built safeguarding eLearning content or only the platform for hosting third-party/client-created content.

*This document was compiled from publicly available web content and search results. It is intended as a comprehensive reference for ongoing project work involving Phew Design Limited.*

## Follow-Up Scrape Results (Phase 0b)

**Follow-up date:** 2026-02-14
**Method:** WebSearch (Firecrawl MCP and WebFetch were unavailable due to tool permissions; results gathered via web search indexing and project lead input)

---

### 13. Training Session Attendees (Confirmed by Project Lead)

The following 9 named individuals attended the AI training sessions with Phew Design Limited:

| Name | Role (where identified) |
|------|------------------------|
| **Andrew Tate** | Full Stack Developer (joined 2021; also performs client support) |
| **Jelka Witherall** | Executive Assistant (supports MD Matthew Burgess and the wider team) |
| **Matt Bushby** | Client Success Lead (deep understanding of Learning & Talent Management in SaaS) |
| **Matthew Burgess** | Managing Director and Founder (started the company in 2001) |
| **Nick McCallum** | Lead Developer (driving force behind system stability and performance) |
| **Scott Rowley** | Account Manager |
| **Suzanne Tanser** | Senior Sales Executive (joined Phew; previous experience at Rightmove, Imparta, Mercia Group) |
| **Amanda Kelly** | Client Service Manager (joined November 2020; background as developer turned PM/programme manager; 8 years in finance sector; describes role as "bridge between client and team") |
| **Stuart Hunter** | Role not confirmed from public sources (likely development or technical role based on team composition) |

**Employee count (confirmed):** 9--11 staff.

**Note on Matthew Burgess:** The initial research listed only "Matthew" as MD. His full name is **Matthew Burgess**, confirmed via the "20 Years of Phew" blog post (https://www.phew.org.uk/2021/05/20-years-of-phew-blog-by-matthew-burgess/) and Companies House records.

---

### 14. Additional Team Members (Not in Training Attendee List)

The following staff were identified from website and search results but were not among the 9 training attendees:

| Name | Role | Source |
|------|------|--------|
| **Salma Miah** | Business Support Manager (HR contact, daily operations, compliance) | Website careers page, contact details |
| **Mike Halliwell** | Sales Development Representative (new joiner) | The Phew Team blog archives |
| **Kathryn Rose** | Account Executive (new joiner) | Blog post: "Welcome to our new Account Executive, Kathryn Rose" |

This brings the total identified staff to at least 12 named individuals, though some (e.g. Kathryn Rose, Mike Halliwell) may be more recent hires or may have since moved on. The confirmed headcount of 9--11 suggests the current team at any given time is smaller than the full historical roster.

- Product feature announcements (audit system updates) in mid-2023
- Team spotlight posts ("Meet the team") used for employer branding

### 16. Additional Case Studies

The following case study pages were found that were not listed in Section 4:

| Client | URL | Summary |
|--------|-----|---------|
| **Portsmouth Safeguarding Children Board (PSCB)** | https://www.phew.org.uk/case-studies/portsmouth-safeguarding-children-board/ | Website design and development. Replaced outdated, cluttered site with a new CMS-based responsive website. Soft launch within one month, full launch one week later. 13% increase in website hits. Stakeholders praised improved user-friendliness and simplified admin/reporting. |
| **Connexions Dudley** | https://www.phew.org.uk/case-studies/connexions-dudley/ | Youth-based charity. Phew built a brand new, fully functional website designed to inspire their youth audience. |

**Updated aggregate client count:** The original research listed 6 named case study clients. With Portsmouth PSCB and Connexions Dudley, the confirmed named case study count rises to 8.

### 17. Additional Service Detail: Accessibility as a Service (AaaS)

A glossary/service page was discovered at:
**URL:** https://www.phew.org.uk/glossary/aaas-accessibility-as-a-service/

This formalises what was mentioned in Section 2.3 ("Accessibility as a service -- ongoing compliance maintenance") as a named, standalone service offering. AaaS appears to be positioned as an ongoing monitoring and remediation service for public sector website clients, ensuring continued WCAG compliance beyond the initial website build.

### 18. Phew Framework Newsletter

A newsletters archive was found on the framework subdomain:
**URL:** https://framework.phew.org.uk/newsletters

This confirms that Phew operates a newsletter distribution system for their website framework clients, consistent with the feature listed in Section 2.3 ("Streamlined newsletter distribution -- no third-party tools needed").

### 19. "Try it for Free" Page

The URL https://www.phew.org.uk/try-it-for-free/ was listed in the initial site structure (Section 10) but not described. Search results confirm this is a lead generation page, likely offering a free trial or demo of the LMS or Audit System. No further detail was extractable without a direct page scrape.

### 20. Remaining Research Gaps (Updated)

After this follow-up, the following gaps from Section 12 have been **resolved or partially resolved:**

| Original Gap | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Full team listing | **Substantially resolved.** 12 named individuals identified with roles for most. Stuart Hunter's role remains unconfirmed from public sources. |
| Full client list | **Partially improved.** Two additional case studies found (Portsmouth PSCB, Connexions Dudley). Aggregate numbers remain the best available data. |

The following gaps **remain open:**

1. **Pricing information** -- still not publicly visible
2. **Revenue and financial data** -- not publicly disclosed (would require Companies House filing review)
3. **Technology stack depth** -- no additional technologies identified beyond those in Section 8
4. **Competitor positioning** -- no competitor comparisons found
5. **eLearning content library** -- still unclear whether Phew provides pre-built content or only the hosting platform
6. **Stuart Hunter's role** -- not identifiable from public web sources; the project lead may be able to confirm
7. **Direct team page scrape** -- the team page at https://www.phew.org.uk/about-phew/the-team/ was not directly scraped due to tool permission restrictions; a future scrape may reveal additional bios, photos, and role descriptions not captured via search indexing
