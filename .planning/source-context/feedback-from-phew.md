# Reference for Liam - AI Consultant

## Feedback from Phew!'s MD

I'm pleased to provide this reference for Liam, who delivered AI training to our team at Phew Design Limited yesterday.

Liam demonstrated strong technical expertise throughout the session, guiding our team through practical AI implementation strategies. His depth of knowledge was evident, and he effectively communicated complex concepts in ways that resonated with our team.

The session covered valuable ground including:

- Efficient session management and prompt engineering
- Strategic use of AI Skills features
- Best practices for getting optimal results from AI tools

Our team found the training genuinely useful, with several members noting they gained actionable insights they can apply immediately. Liam's approach was thorough and detail-oriented, ensuring we understood not just the 'how' but the 'why' behind effective AI usage.

**One constructive observation:** the depth of detail occasionally made it challenging to retain all the key points. A summary document or cheat-sheet highlighting the core techniques would have been a valuable addition to cement the learning - though this doesn't diminish the quality of the content delivered.

Overall, Liam provided a solid training session that has equipped our team with practical AI skills. I'd recommend him to other organisations looking to upskill their teams in AI tools and workflows.

Regards,
Matthew


## Feedback from speaking with Phew! team

### What worked well

- Strong technical expertise came through clearly
- Good coverage of core AI implementation strategies
- Team gained actionable insights on session management, Skills usage, and prompt engineering

### Suggestions for future sessions

**Pacing and accessibility:** At times we got deep into technical detail quite early. This worked for some team members but others found it harder to follow. Starting with high-level concepts before diving into the technical weeds might help everyone stay engaged throughout. 

**Take-away materials:** A cheat-sheet or summary document with the key headlines would be really helpful - things like "start new sessions quickly but export the last one", "use Skills", "ask questions early for best prompts". This would help cement the learning and give people something to reference back to.
