# UK English

All output must use UK English spelling, grammar, and conventions.

## Spelling Rules

Use British English spellings throughout:

- -ise endings (not -ize): organise, recognise, specialise, optimise
- -our endings (not -or): colour, behaviour, favour, honour
- -re endings (not -er): centre, metre, theatre (except for computer-related
  "center" in CSS/code)
- -ence endings where applicable: licence (noun), defence, offence
- Double L: travelling, modelling, labelling, cancelled
- Other: grey (not gray), programme (not program, unless computer program),
  cheque (not check, for banking)

## Grammar Conventions

- Collective nouns may take plural verbs: "the team are working on..."
- "Whilst", "amongst", "towards" are preferred over "while", "among", "toward"
- Past tense: "learnt", "spelt", "dreamt" are acceptable alongside "learned",
  "spelled", "dreamed"

## Formatting Conventions

- Dates: DD/MM/YYYY or DD Month YYYY (e.g., 14/02/2026 or 14 February 2026)
- Currency: GBP, use £ symbol (e.g., £500, not $500)
- Time: 24-hour format preferred in formal contexts (e.g., 14:00), 12-hour
  acceptable informally (e.g., 2pm -- no space, no full stops in am/pm)
- Quotation marks: single quotes for primary quotation, double quotes for quotes
  within quotes
- Full stops and commas go outside closing quotation marks unless part of the
  quoted material

## In Code Contexts

- Use UK English only in comments, documentation, and user-facing strings
- Never change variable names, function names, CSS properties, or API parameters
  (these follow their language's conventions, typically US English)
- Example: write `// Initialise the colour palette` but keep
  `const color = getColor()`
