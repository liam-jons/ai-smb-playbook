# Brand Voice Setup Prompt

documenting your brand voice. Fill in the bracketed sections with your own
details before sending.

I'd like to create a comprehensive brand voice document for our company. Please
guide me through the process step by step, covering all seven areas:

1. Brand Personality
2. Voice Attributes (3-5 attributes with "we are / we are not / sounds like"
   definitions)
3. Audience Awareness
4. Core Messaging Pillars
5. Tone Spectrum (how our voice adapts across channels and situations)
6. Style Rules (grammar, formatting, punctuation decisions)
7. Terminology (preferred terms, product names, inclusive language)

Here's what I can share to start:

**Company:** [Company name] **What we do:** [Brief description] **Who we
serve:** [Primary audience]

**Examples of content that sounds like us:** [Paste 2-3 examples of on-brand
content — website copy, emails, social posts]

**Examples of content that does NOT sound like us (if available):** [Paste any
examples that felt off-brand]

**Existing guidelines (if any):** [Paste or describe any existing brand/style
guidelines]

Please work through each section one at a time, asking me questions and
presenting options before moving to the next. When we're done, compile
everything into a single brand voice document I can save and reuse.
