## What We Were Working On

I am working on a series of three blog posts about how technology is improving
safeguarding in the education sector. These are for our company blog and will
also be shared on LinkedIn. The target audience is school administrators and
safeguarding leads — they are knowledgeable about safeguarding but not
particularly technical.

**Project:** Blog series — 'Technology and Safeguarding in Education'
**Started:** 10/02/2026 **Goal:** Three publish-ready blog posts of
approximately 800-1,000 words each, with consistent tone and messaging.

---

## What Was Accomplished

- Outlined all three posts and agreed on the structure:
  1. 'Why Digital Safeguarding Matters More Than Ever' (awareness/problem)
  2. 'Five Questions to Ask When Choosing a Safeguarding Platform' (evaluation
     guide)
  3. 'Building a Culture of Digital Safety in Your School' (practical
     implementation)
- Completed a full draft of Post 1 ('Why Digital Safeguarding Matters More Than
  Ever')
- Reviewed the draft against our brand voice guidelines — made adjustments to
  tone (was too formal in places, needed to be more approachable)
- Agreed on key messaging: lead with the human impact, support with data, avoid
  fear-mongering
- Decided not to mention specific competitor products by name
- Identified three statistics from DfE reports to include across the series

---

## What Needs to Happen Next

- Write the first draft of Post 2 ('Five Questions to Ask When Choosing a
  Safeguarding Platform')
- The five questions should be practical and vendor-neutral — not a sales pitch
  for our platform
- After drafting Post 2, review both Post 1 and Post 2 together for consistency
  of tone
- If time allows, begin outlining Post 3 in more detail

---

## Important Things to Remember

- **Tone:** Professional but warm. We are experts sharing knowledge, not
  lecturing. Use 'you' and 'your school' to speak directly to the reader.
- **UK English throughout** — organise, colour, behaviour, etc.
- **No fear-mongering** — do not use scare tactics or worst-case scenarios to
  sell. Focus on empowerment and proactive measures.
- **No competitor mentions** — keep the content vendor-neutral. We can reference
  'modern safeguarding platforms' generically.
- **Length:** 800-1,000 words per post. Shorter is better — these readers are
  busy.
- **The DfE statistics** we found: 1 in 5 children have experienced online
  bullying (2024 survey), 78% of schools report increased demand for digital
  safeguarding tools, average school handles 4.2 safeguarding concerns per week
  that involve a digital element.
- **Post 1 is done** — do not rewrite it unless I specifically ask. It has been
  approved.

## Instructions for Claude

- Continue in the same conversational, expert tone we established in Post 1
- When drafting Post 2, make the five questions genuinely useful — the kind of
  questions a safeguarding lead would actually want answered
- Do not make the questions leading towards our product; keep them objective
- Ask me before making significant changes to the agreed structure
- If you suggest including a statistic, please flag whether it is one of the
  three we already verified or a new one that I will need to check
